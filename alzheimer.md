## Markdown of the Notes

**Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein** >> insoluble filaments and big tubular aggregates = *neurofibrillary tangles*;
The brain's clearance system is unable to eliminate the aggregates, then lead to inflammatroy process and neuronal death.

The neuronal death and axonal dysfunction leads to a disconnection of regions in brain networks.

function of tau protein: Maintaining the stability of microtubules in axon.

steps to NFT (neurofibrillary tangles)
1. lose natural function
2. disturbed axonal transportation of vesicles - bad transmission
3. hyperphosphorylated tau protein >> insoluble filaments = NFT
4. neuron death. Connectivity breakdown
