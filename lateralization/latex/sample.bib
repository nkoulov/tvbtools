	abstract = {Motion-contaminated T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results in misestimates of brain structure. Because conventional T1w scans are not collected with direct measures of head motion, a practical alternative is needed to identify potential motion-induced bias in measures of brain anatomy. Head movements during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning of 266 healthy adults (20–89 years) were analyzed to reveal stable features of in-scanner head motion. The magnitude of head motion increased with age and exhibited within-participant stability across different fMRI scans. fMRI head motion was then related to measurements of both quality control (QC) and brain anatomy derived from a T1w structural image from the same scan session. A procedure was adopted to “ﬂag” individuals exhibiting excessive head movement during fMRI or poor T1w quality rating. The ﬂagging procedure reliably reduced the inﬂuence of head motion on estimates of gray matter thickness across the cortical surface. Moreover, T1w images from ﬂagged participants exhibited reduced estimates of gray matter thickness and volume in comparison to age- and gender-matched samples, resulting in inﬂated effect sizes in the relationships between regional anatomical measures and age. Gray matter thickness differences were noted in numerous regions previously reported to undergo prominent atrophy with age. Recommendations are provided for mitigating this potential confound, and highlight how the procedure may lead to more accurate measurement and comparison of anatomical features.

	abstract = {Pain sensing neurons in the periphery (called nociceptors) and the central neurons that receive their projections show remarkable plasticity following injury. This plasticity results in amplification of pain signaling that is now understood to be crucial for the recovery and survival of organisms following injury. These same plasticity mechanisms may drive a transition to a nonadaptive chronic pain state if they fail to resolve following the termination of the healing process. Remarkable advances have been achieved in the past two decades in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie pain plasticity following injury. The mechanisms bear a striking resemblance to molecular mechanisms involved in learning and memory processes in other brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Here those mechanisms, their commonalities and subtle differences, will be highlighted and their role in causing chronic pain will be discussed. Arising from these data is the striking argument that chronic pain is a disease of the nervous system, which distinguishes this phenomena from acute pain that is frequently a symptom alerting the organism to injury. This argument has important implications for the development of disease modifying therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Here, we demonstrate that subject motion produces substantial changes in the timecourses of resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data despite compensatory spatial registration and regression of motion estimates from the data. These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.},

Several resting-state functional connectivity MRI reports have implicated regions of the default mode system as brain hubs; we demonstrate that previous degree-based approaches to hub identiﬁcation may have identiﬁed portions of large brain systems rather than critical nodes of brain networks. We utilize two methods to identify hub-like brain regions: (1) ﬁnding network nodes that participate in multiple subnetworks of the brain, and (2) ﬁnding spatial locations in which several systems are represented within a small volume. These methods converge on a distributed set of regions that differ from previous reports on hubs. This work identiﬁes regions that support multiple systems, leading to spatially constrained predictions about brain function that may be tested in terms of lesions, evoked responses, and dynamic patterns of activity.},

Yet, the neurobiological pathways through which socioeconomic status (SES) shapes development remain poorly understood. Behavioral evidence suggests that language, memory, socialemotional processing, and cognitive control exhibit relatively large differences across SES. Here we investigated whether volumetric differences could be observed across SES in several neural regions that support these skills. In a sample of 60 socioeconomically diverse children, highly significant SES differences in regional brain volume were observed in the hippocampus and the amygdala. In addition, SES · age interactions were observed in the left superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting increasing SES differences with age in these regions. These results were not explained by differences in gender, race or IQ. Likely mechanisms include differences in the home linguistic environment and exposure to stress, which may serve as targets for intervention at a time of high neural plasticity.},

	abstract = {There is consistent evidence that brain volume changes in early and late life. Most longitudinal studies usually only span a few years and include a limited number of participants. In this review, we integrate ﬁndings from 56 longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on whole brain volume change in healthy individuals. The individual longitudinal MRI studies describe only the development in a limited age range. In total, 2,211 participants were included. Age at ﬁrst measurement varied between 4 and 88 years of age. The studies included in this review were performed using a large range of methods (e.g., different scanner protocols and different acquisition parameters). We applied a weighted regression analysis to estimate the age dependency of the rate of relative annual brain volume change across studies. The results indicate that whole brain volume changes throughout the life span. A wave of growth occurs during childhood/adolescence, where around 9 years of age a 1\% annual brain growth is found which levels off until at age 13 a gradual volume decrease sets in. During young adulthood, between \$18 and 35 years of age, possibly another wave of growth occurs or at least a period of no brain tissue loss. After age 35 years, a steady volume loss is found of 0.2\% per year, which accelerates gradually to an annual brain volume loss of 0.5\% at age 60. The brains of people over 60 years of age show a steady volume loss of more than 0.5\%. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these plastic brain changes may contribute to distinguishing progressive brain changes in psychiatric and neurological diseases from healthy aging processes.

The present study was carried out to explore whether empathic racial bias for pain is modulated by minimal group. Chinese/Western faces with neutral expressions receiving painful (needle penetration) or non-painful (Q-tip touch) stimulation were presented. Participants were asked to rate the pain intensity felt by Chinese/Western models of ingroup/outgroup members. Their implicit racial bias were also measured. Two lines of evidence indicated that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was modulated by racial bias: (1) Chinese models elicited stronger activity than Western did in the ACC, and (2) activity in the ACC was modulated by implicit racial bias. Whereas the right anterior insula (rAI) were modulated by ingroup bias, in which ingroup member elicited stronger activity than outgroup member did. Furthermore, activity in the ACC was modulated by activity of rAI (i.e., ingroup bias) in the pain condition, while activity in the rAI was modulated by activity of ACC (i.e., racial bias) in the nopain condition. Our results provide evidence that there are different neural correlates for racial bias and ingroup bias, and neural racial bias for pain can be modulated by minimal group.},

The present study investigates the neural processes preceding the willingness to engage in costly helping toward ingroup and outgroup members. Soccer fans witnessed a fan of their favorite team (ingroup member) or of a rival team (outgroup member) experience pain. They were subsequently able to choose to help the other by enduring physical pain themselves to reduce the other’s pain. Helping the ingroup member was best predicted by anterior insula activation when seeing him suffer and by associated self-reports of empathic concern. In contrast, not helping the outgroup member was best predicted by nucleus accumbens activation and the degree of negative evaluation of the other. We conclude that empathy-related insula activation can motivate costly helping, whereas an antagonistic signal in nucleus accumbens reduces the propensity to help.},

	abstract = {Social relationships affect empathy in humans such that empathic neural responses to perceived pain were stronger to racial in-group members than to racial out-group members. Why does the racial bias in empathy (RBE) occur and how can we reduce it? We hypothesized that perceiving an other-race person as a symbol of a racial group, rather than as an individual, decreases references to his/her personal situation and weakens empathy for that person. This hypothesis predicts that individuating other-race persons by increasing attention to each individual's feelings or enclosing other-race individuals within one's own social group can reduce the RBE by increasing empathic neural responses to other-race individuals. In Experiment 1, we recorded event related brain potentials from Chinese adults as they made race judgments on Asian and Caucasian faces with pain or neutral expressions. We identiﬁed the RBE by showing that, relative to neutral expressions, pain expressions increased neural responses at 128–188 ms after stimulus onset over the frontal/central brain regions, and this effect was evident for same-race faces but not for other-race faces. Experiments 2 and 3 found that paying attention to observed individual's feelings of pain and including other-race individuals in one's own team for competitions respectively eliminated the RBE by increasing neural responses to pain expressions in other-race faces. Our results indicate that the RBE is not inevitable and that manipulations of both cognitive strategies and intergroup relationships can decrease RBE-related brain activity.},

We recorded event-related brain potentials to painful versus neutral expressions of same-race and other-race faces when participants held a cold or warm pack. We found that brain activity in the N2 (200–340 ms) and P3 (400–600 ms) time windows over the frontal/central region was positively shifted by painful (vs. neutral) expressions. Moreover, the N2/P3 empathic neural responses were signiﬁcantly larger for same-race than other-race faces in the cold but not in the warm condition. Moreover, subjective ratings of diﬀerent temperatures in the cold vs. warm conditions predicted larger changes of racial ingroup bias in empathic neural responses in the N2 time window.

We investigated genetic associations of racial ingroup bias in the brain activity to racial ingroup and outgroup faces that received painful or non-painful stimulations by scanning A/A and G/G homozygous of the oxytocin receptor gene polymorphism (OXTR rs53576) using functional MRI. We found that G/G compared to A/A individuals showed stronger activity in the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor area (ACC/SMA) in response to racial ingroup members' pain, whereas A/A relative to G/G individuals exhibited greater activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in response to racial outgroup members' pain. Moreover, the racial ingroup bias in ACC/SMA activity positively predicted participants' racial ingroup bias in implicit attitudes and NAcc activity to racial outgroup individuals' pain negatively predicted participants' motivations to reduce racial outgroup members' pain.

The current study further investigated whether real-life cultural experiences with other-race individuals can reduce the racial bias in empathic neural responses to others’ suffering. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 20 Chinese adults who were brought up in Western countries (United States, United Kingdom, and Canada) where Caucasians consist of the majority of population. Participants viewed video clips in which either Asian or Caucasian models received painful or non-painful stimulations. We found that the neural activity in the pain matrix including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, inferior frontal cortex and somatosensory cortex was signiﬁcantly increased in response to painful versus nonpainful stimuli applied to both Asian and Caucasian models. Moreover, these empathic neural responses to Asian and Caucasian models did not differ signiﬁcantly and were positively correlated with each other.

Subjectively negative outcomes (failure of the favored team or success of the rival team) activated anterior cingulate cortex and insula, whereas positive outcomes (success of the favored team or failure of the rival team, even against a third team) activated ventral striatum. The ventral striatum effect, associated with subjective pleasure, also correlated with self-reported likelihood of aggressing against a fan of the rival team (controlling for general aggression).

Empathic responses can be modulated by race, such that stronger neural activation is elicited by the perception of pain in people of the same race compared with another race. In the present study, we aimed to identify when racial bias occurs in the time course of neural empathic responses to pain. We also investigated whether group afﬁliation could modulate the race effect. Using the minimal group paradigm, we assigned participants to one of two mixed-race teams. We examined event-related potentials from participants when viewing members of their own and the other team receiving painful or non-painful touch. We identiﬁed a signiﬁcant racial bias in early ERP components at N1 over frontal electrodes, where Painful stimuli elicited a greater negative shift relative to Non-Painful stimuli in response to own race faces only. A long latency empathic response was also found at P3, where there was signiﬁcant differentiation between Painful and Non-Painful stimuli regardless of Race or Group. There was no evidence that empathyrelated brain activity was modulated by minimal group manipulation. These results support a model of empathy for pain that consists of early, automatic bias towards own-race empathic responses and a later top-down cognitive evaluation that does not differentiate between races and may ultimately lead to unbiased behaviour.},

We scanned Chinese adults, using functional MRI, while they categorized Asian and Caucasian faces with pain or neutral expressions in terms of race or identiﬁed painful feelings of each individual face. We found that pain vs. neutral expressions of Asian but not Caucasian faces activated the anterior cingulate (ACC) and anterior insular (AI) activity during race judgments. However, pain compared to race judgments increased ACC and AI activity to pain expressions of Caucasian but not Asian faces. Moreover, race judgments induced increased activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex whereas pain judgments increased activity in the bilateral temporoparietal junction. The results suggest that task demands emphasizing an individual's painful feeling increase ACC/AI activities to pain expressions of racial out-group members and reduce the racial bias in empathic neural responses.},

Event-related brain potentials were recorded in Chinese male adults during race judgments on Asian and Caucasian faces expressing pain or showing a neutral expression after intranasal self-administration of OT or placebo. A fronto-central positive activity at 128–188 ms (P2) was of larger amplitude in response to the pain expressions compared with the neutral expressions of racial in-group members but not of racial out-group members. OT treatment increased this racial in-group bias in neural responses and resulted in its correlation with a positive implicit attitude toward racial in-group members. Our ﬁndings suggest that OT interacts with the intergroup relationship to modulate empathic neural responses to others’ suffering.},

	abstract = {Pleasure experience is an important part of normal healthy life and is essential for general and mental wellbeing. Many neuroimaging studies have investigated the underlying neural processing of verbal and visual modalities of reward. However, how the brain processes rewards in the olfactory modality is not fully understood. This study aimed to examine the neural basis of olfactory rewards in 25 healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We developed an Olfactory Incentive Delay (OLID) imaging task distinguishing between the anticipation and receipt of olfactory rewards and punishments. We found that the pallidum was activated during the anticipation of both olfactory rewards and punishments. The bilateral insula was activated independently from the odours’ hedonic valence during the receipt phase. In addition, right caudate activation during the anticipation of unpleasant odours was correlated with self-reported anticipatory hedonic traits, whereas bilateral insular activation during the receipt of pleasant odours was correlated with selfreported consummatory hedonic traits. These ﬁndings suggest that activity in the insula and the caudate may be biomarkers of anhedonia. These ﬁndings also highlight a useful and valid paradigm to study the neural circuitry underlying reward processing in people with anhedonia.},

We recorded event-related brain potentials to painful vs neutral expressions of Asian and Caucasian faces that were assigned to a fellow team or an opponent team in Chinese carriers of G/G or A/A allele of OXTR. We found that G/G carriers showed greater neural responses at 136–176 ms (P2) over the frontal/central region to painful vs neutral expressions of faces with shared either racial or mini group identity. In contrast, A/A carriers showed significant empathic neural responses in the P2 time window only to the faces with both shared racial and mini group identity. Moreover, the racial in-group bias in empathic neural responses varied across individuals’ empathy traits and ethnic identity for G/G but not A/A carriers. Our findings provide electrophysiological evidence for greater f lexibility of empathic neural responses in intergroup contexts in G/G (vs A/A) carriers of OXTR and suggest interactions between OXTR and intergroup relationships on empathy for others’ suffering.},

Using fMRI, we scanned human subjects who were presented with visual cues that signaled subsequent reinforcement with a pleasant sweet taste (1 M glucose), a moderately unpleasant salt taste (0.2 M saline), or a neutral taste. Expectation of a pleasant taste produced activation in dopaminergic midbrain, posterior dorsal amygdala, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Apart from OFC, these regions were not activated by reward receipt. The findings indicate that when rewards are predictable, brain regions recruited during expectation are, in part, dissociable from areas responding to reward receipt.},

Comparison of retronasal versus orthonasal delivery produced preferential activity in the mouth area at the base of the central sulcus, possibly reflecting olfactory referral to the mouth, associated with retronasal olfaction. Routes of delivery produced differential activation in the insula/operculum, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex in orthonasal {\textgreater} retronasal and in the perigenual cingulate and medial orbitofrontal cortex in retronasal {\textgreater} orthonasal in response to chocolate, but not lavender, butanol, or farnesol, so that an interaction of route and odorant may be inferred.

Basic science points to the importance of distinguishing between anticipatory and consummatory (or inthe-moment) pleasure experiences, and this distinction may help to reconcile the mixed findings on anhedonia in schizophrenia. In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that anhedonia in schizophrenia reflects a deficit in anticipatory pleasure but not consummatory pleasure. In Study 1, we used experience sampling methodology to assess reported experiences of consummatory and anticipated pleasure among schizophrenia patients and controls. In Study 2, schizophrenia patients and controls completed a self-report trait measure of anticipatory and consummatory pleasure and interviews that assessed negative symptoms, including anhedonia, and community functioning. In both studies, we found evidence for an anticipatory but not a consummatory pleasure deficit in schizophrenia. In addition, anticipatory pleasure was related to clinical ratings of anhedonia and functional outcome. Clinical and research implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity MRI, based on Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) signals, is typically performed while the subject is at rest. On the other hand, BOLD is also widely used in physiological imaging such as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) mapping using hypercapnia (HC) as a modulator. We therefore hypothesize that hypercapnia BOLD data can be used to extract FC metrics after factoring out the effects of the physiological modulation, which will allow simultaneous assessment of neural and vascular function and may be particularly important in populations such as aging and cerebrovascular diseases. The present work aims to systematically examine the feasibility of hypercapnia BOLD-based FC mapping using three commonly applied analysis methods, specifically dual-regression Independent Component Analysis (ICA), regionbased FC matrix analysis, and graph-theory based network analysis, in a large cohort of 170 healthy subjects ranging from 20-88 years old. To validate the hypercapnia BOLD results, we also compared these FC metrics with those obtained from conventional resting-state data. ICA analysis of the hypercapnia BOLD data revealed FC maps that strongly resembled those reported in the literature. FC matrix using region-based analysis showed a correlation of 0.97 on the group-level and 0.54±0.10 on the individual-level, when comparing between hypercapnia and resting-state results. Although the correspondence on the individual-level was moderate, this was primarily attributed to variations intrinsic to FC mapping, because a corresponding resting-vsresting comparison in a sub-cohort (N=39) revealed a similar correlation of 0.57±0.09. Graphtheory computations were also feasible in hypercapnia BOLD data and indices of global efficiency, clustering coefficient, modularity, and segregation were successfully derived. hypercapnia FC results revealed age-dependent differences in which within-network connections generally exhibited an age-dependent decrease while between-network connections showed an age-dependent increase.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most prominent characteristics of psychiatric disorders. Currently, the neural correlates of cognitive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate functional connectivity and structural perturbations across psychiatric diagnoses in three neurocognitive networks of interest: the default mode network (DMN), the frontoparietal network (FPN), and the salience network (SN).
METHODS: We performed meta-analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging whole-brain seedbased functional connectivity in 8298 patients (involving eight disorders) and 8165 healthy control subjects and a voxel-based morphometry analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging data in 14,027 patients (involving eight disorders) and 14,504 healthy control subjects. To aid the interpretation of the results, we examined neurocognitive function in 776 healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project.
RESULTS: We found that the three neurocognitive networks of interest were characterized by shared alterations of functional connectivity architecture across psychiatric disorders. More speciﬁcally, hypoconnectivity was expressed between the DMN and ventral SN and between the SN and FPN, whereas hyperconnectivity was evident between the DMN and FPN and between the DMN and dorsal SN. This pattern of network alterations was associated with gray matter reductions in patients and was localized in regions that subserve general cognitive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the ﬁrst to provide meta-analytic evidence of common alterations of functional connectivity within and between neurocognitive networks. The ﬁndings suggest a shared mechanism of network interactions that may associate with the generalized cognitive deﬁcits observed in psychiatric disorders.},

We explored whether taste-smell interactions occur at the central level, by delivering odorants (strawberry, soy sauce, odorless water) and tastants (sucrose, sodium chloride) separately, and whether effects of imagined odors are comparable to those of physically presented odors. We found specific taste-smell interactions: sweetness enhancement induced by strawberry odor and saltiness enhancement induced by soy sauce odor. These interactions were elicited with separate delivery of olfactory and gustatory stimuli. Secondly, we found a similar but rather limited effect with the imagined odors: imagined strawberry enhanced perceived sweetness of water solutions, and imagined soy sauce enhanced perceived saltiness of weak sodium chloride solutions. We concluded that OICTP is a centrally mediated phenomenon, and that imagined odors can to some extent induce changes in perceived taste intensity comparable to those elicited by perceived odors.},

Hi-res fMRI (voxel volume ≤ (2 mm)3) is robustly achievable in human studies today using widely available clinical 3-Tesla scanners. However, the neuroscientific exploitation of the greater spatial detail poses four challenges: (1) Hi-res fMRI may give inaccurate (i.e. blurred, displaced and distorted) images of fine-scale neuronal activity patterns. (2) Single small voxels yield very noisy measurements. (3) The greater number of voxels complicates interpretation and poses a more severe multiple-comparisons problem. (4) The functional correspondency mapping between individual brains is unknown at the fine scale of millimeters. Here we argue that these challenges can be met by shifting the focus of brain mapping and visualizing, not the activity patterns themselves, but the amount of information they convey about the experimental conditions.},

Here, we extend the functional overlap perspective to the neurochemical level and test whether a common physical painkiller, acetaminophen (paracetamol), can reduce empathy for another’s pain. In two double-blind placebocontrolled experiments, participants rated perceived pain, personal distress and empathic concern in response to reading scenarios about another’s physical or social pain, witnessing ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving painful noise blasts.

	abstract = {Social pain after exclusion by others activates brain regions also involved in physical pain. Here we evaluated whether monetary reward could compensate for the negative feeling of social pain in the brain. To address this question we used the unique technique of intracranial electroencephalography in subjects with drug resistant epilepsy. Speciﬁcally, we recorded theta activity from intracranial electrodes implanted in the insular cortex while subjects experienced conditions of social inclusion and exclusion associated with monetary gain and loss. Our study conﬁrmed that theta rhythm in the insular cortex is the neural signature of social exclusion. We found that while monetary gain suppresses the effect of social pain in the anterior insula, there is no such effect in the posterior insula. These results imply that the anterior insula can use secondary reward signals to compensate for the negative feeling of social pain. Hence, here we propose that the anterior insula plays a pivotal role in integrating contingencies to update social pain feelings. Finally, the possibility to modulate the theta rhythm through the reward system might open new avenues of research for treating pathologies related to social exclusion.},

Converging lines of evidence suggest that biological factors that inﬂuence the experience of physical pain may also relate to social pain. An open question, however, is whether higher blood pressure per se is a biological factor associated with lower sensitivity to social pain. This possible association was tested in three studies. Consistent with prior ﬁndings on physical pain, higher resting blood pressure was associated with lower self-reported sensitivity to social pain across individuals (Study 1 r = −.303, Study 2 r = −.262, −.246), even after adjusting for confounding factors related to blood pressure (Study 3 r = −.222). Findings suggest a previously unknown biological correlate of sensitivity to social pain, providing further evidence for possible shared substrates for physical and social pain.},

Here, we show that monkeys' amygdala neurons derive object values from observation and use these values to simulate a partner monkey's decision process. While monkeys alternated making reward-based choices, amygdala neurons encoded object-specific values learned from observation. Dynamic activities converted these values to representations of the recorded monkey's own choices. Surprisingly, the same activity patterns unfolded spontaneously before partner's choices in separate neurons, as if these neurons simulated the partner's decision-making. These "simulation neurons" encoded signatures of mutual-inhibitory decision computation, including value comparisons and value-to-choice conversions, resulting in accurate predictions of partner's choices. Population decoding identified differential contributions of amygdala subnuclei. Biophysical modeling of amygdala circuits showed that simulation neurons emerge naturally from convergence between object-value neurons and self-other neurons. By simulating decision computations during observation, these neurons could allow primates to reconstruct their social partners' mental states.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a time of increased social-affective sensitivity, which is often related to heightened health-risk behaviors. However, moderate levels of social sensitivity, relative to either low (social vacuum) or high levels (exceptionally attuned), may confer benefits as it facilitates effective navigation of the social world. The present fMRI study tested a curvilinear relationship between social sensitivity and adaptive decision-making. Participants (ages 12-16; N = 35) played the Social Analogue Risk Task (SART), which measures participants' willingness to knock on doors in order to earn points. With each knock, the facial expression of the house's resident shifted from happy to somewhat angrier. If the resident became too angry, the door slammed and participants lost points. Social sensitivity was defined as the extent to which adolescents adjusted their risky choices based on shifting facial expressions. Results confirmed a curvilinear relationship between social sensitivity and self-reported adaptive decision-making at the behavioral and neural level. Moderate adolescent social sensitivity was modulated via heightened tracking of social cues in the TPJ, insula and dlPFC and related to adaptive decision-making. These findings suggest that social-affective sensitivity may positively impact outcomes in adolescence and have implications for interventions to help adolescents reach mature social goals into adulthood.},

As global consumption of sugar-sweetened products has sharply increased in recent years, examining the validity of claims of an association between CHOs and mood is of high importance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between acute CHO ingestion and mood. We examined the time-course of CHO–mood interactions and considered the role of moderator variables potentially affecting the CHO–mood relationship. Analysis of 176 effect sizes (31 studies, 1259 participants) revealed no positive effect of CHOs on any aspect of mood at any time-point following their consumption. However, CHO administration was associated with higher levels of fatigue and less alertness compared with placebo within the first hour post-ingestion. These findings challenge the idea that CHOs can improve mood, and might be used to increase the public's awareness that the ‘sugar rush’ is a myth, inform health policies to decrease sugar consumption, and promote healthier alternatives.},

	abstract = {Beliefs and expectations often persist despite evidence to the contrary. Here we examine two potential mechanisms underlying such ‘self-reinforcing’ expectancy effects in the pain domain: modulation of perception and biased learning. In two experiments, cues previously associated with symbolic representations of high or low temperatures preceded painful heat. We examined trial-to-trial dynamics in participants’ expected pain, reported pain and brain activity. Subjective and neural pain responses assimilated towards cue-based expectations, and pain responses in turn predicted subsequent expectations, creating a positive dynamic feedback loop. Furthermore, we found evidence for a confirmation bias in learning: higher- and lower-than-expected pain triggered greater expectation updating for high- and low-pain cues, respectively. Individual differences in this bias were reflected in the updating of pain-anticipatory brain activity. Computational modelling provided converging evidence that expectations influence both perception and learning. Together, perceptual assimilation and biased learning promote self-reinforcing expectations, helping to explain why beliefs can be resistant to change.},

	abstract = {Background: Although Theory of Mind (ToM) impairment has been observed in patients with a wide range of mental disorders, the similarity and uniqueness of these deﬁcits across diagnostic groups has not been thoroughly investigated.
Methods: We recruited 35 participants with schizophrenia (SCZ), 35 with bipolar disorder (BD), 35 with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 35 healthy controls in this study. All participants were matched in age, gender proportion and IQ estimates. The Yoni task, capturing both the cognitive and affective components of ToM at the ﬁrst- and second-order level was administered. Repeated-measure ANOVA and MANOVA were conducted to compare the group differences in ToM performance. A network was then constructed with ToM performances, psychotic and depressive symptoms, and executive function as nodes exploring the clinical correlates of ToM.
Results: Overall, ToM impairments were observed in all patient groups compared with healthy controls, with patients with SCZ performing worse than those with BD. In second-order conditions, patients with SCZ and MDD showed deﬁcits in both cognitive and affective conditions, while patients with BD performed signiﬁcantly poorer in cognitive conditions. Network analysis showed that second-order affective ToM performance was associated with psychotic and depressive symptoms as well as executive dysfunction, while second-order affective ToM performance and negative symptoms showed relatively high centrality in the network.
Conclusions: Patients with SCZ, MDD and BD exhibited different types and severity of impairments in ToM subcomponents. Impairment in higher-order affective ToM appears to be closely related to clinical symptoms in both psychotic and affective disorders.},

These maladaptive emotional states can lead to involuntary opioid overdose and many neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Uncovering the mechanisms responsible for paininduced negative affect is critical in addressing these comorbid outcomes. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, which integrates the aversive and rewarding valence of stimuli, exhibits plastic adaptations in the presence of pain. In discrete regions of the NAc, activation of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) decreases the reinforcing properties of rewards and induces aversive behaviors. Using complementary techniques, we report that in vivo recruitment of NAc shell dynorphin neurons, acting through KOR, is necessary and sufﬁcient to drive pain-induced negative affect. Taken together, our results provide evidence that pain-induced adaptations in the kappa opioid system within the NAc shell represent a functional target for therapeutic intervention that could circumvent pain-induced affective disorders.},

	abstract = {What we pay attention to is inﬂuenced by current task goals (goal-directed attention) [1, 2], the physical salience of stimuli (stimulus-driven attention) [3–5], and selection history [6–12]. This third construct, which encompasses reward learning, aversive conditioning, and repetitive orienting behavior [12–18], is often characterized as a unitary mechanism of control that can be contrasted with the other two [12–14]. Here, we present evidence that two different learning processes underlie the inﬂuence of selection history on attention, with dissociable consequences for orienting behavior. Human observers performed an antisaccade task in which they were paid for shifting their gaze in the direction opposite one of two color-deﬁned targets. Strikingly, such training resulted in a bias to do the opposite of what observers were motivated and paid to do, with associative learning facilitating orienting toward reward cues. On the other hand, repetitive orienting away from a target produced a bias to repeat this behavior even when it conﬂicted with current goals, reﬂecting instrumental conditioning of the orienting response. Our ﬁndings challenge the idea that selection history reﬂects a common mechanism of learning-dependent priority and instead suggest multiple distinct routes by which learning history shapes orienting behavior. We also provide direct evidence for the idea that value-based attention is approach oriented, which limits the effectiveness of attentional bias modiﬁcation techniques that utilize incentive structures.},

	abstract = {A questionnaire-based tool for quantifying self-reported affective reactions to and behavioral disruptions by odorous/pungent substances, called the Chemical Sensitivity Scale (CSS), analogous to the Noise Sensitivity Scale (NSS), was evaluated regarding psychometric properties. Twenty-six members from the Swedish Asthma and Allergy Association and 124 control participants responded to the CSS, the NSS, and to additional questions for evaluation of the validity of the CSS and NSS. The results showed that the CSS generates approximately normal distributions, has good test–retest reliability (rxy ¼ 0:87), good internal consistency (ra ¼ 0:88), and satisfying predictive and concurrent validity. These metric properties of the CSS and NSS were in general very similar. The content validity of the CSS is discussed. Two major dimensions of the CSS appear to represent sensory/somatic and neurasthenic symptoms, respectively. The analogy of the CSS to the NSS implies that use of both scales in combination may enhance understanding for the issue of general environmental sensitivity versus speciﬁc sensitivity to chemicals. Correlation coefﬁcients between CSS and NSS scores for the asthma and allergy members (rxy ¼ 0:40) and controls (rxy ¼ 0:42) imply a moderate correspondence between chemical and noise sensitivity.},

The aim of the present study was to compare olfactory identiﬁcation and olfactory preference in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and demographically matched healthy participants were given the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identiﬁcation Test (UPSIT) to assess olfactory identiﬁcation ability. To examine olfactory hedonic judgment, participants were also asked to indicate their preference for each UPSIT item on a 5-point rating scale, immediately after odor identiﬁcation. Clinical symptoms and social competence were also assessed. Both schizophrenic and bipolar groups showed olfactory identiﬁcation deﬁcits compared with the healthy controls, but schizophrenic patients were more impaired than bipolar patients on the UPSIT accuracy. Interestingly, both bipolar and schizophrenic patients rated odors to be more pleasant than did healthy controls, but all groups preferred odors that they could correctly identify to unidentiﬁed smells. Restricted range of preference ratings was associated with the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, and with mania in bipolar disorder. Social competence was associated with better olfactory identiﬁcation performance. These ﬁndings suggest that olfactory identiﬁcation and preference are compromised in bipolar disorder as well as in schizophrenia, but the precise nature of these abnormalities needs to be further elucidated.},

	abstract = {Background: The term executive functions (EF) describes a set of higher cognitive abilities/skills needed for goaloriented and ﬂexible behavior. In contrast to a multitude of functional neuroimaging studies of EF performance, only limited and partially inconclusive data is available for the structural-neuroanatomical underpinnings of EFs, particularly in healthy adults.
Methods: Here, we applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and additional analyses of cortical thickness (CTH; via surface-based morphometry) to a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (N ¼ 1110; Age 28.8 Æ 3.7 years) with structural MRI data and test data reﬂective of three core EFs [i.e. cognitive ﬂexibility (CF), inhibitory control (IC) and working memory (WM)].
Results: For CF and IC, VBM analyses yielded a distinct and largely overlapping pattern of exclusively negative associations (CF{\textgreater}IC), most prominently within the medial prefrontal cortex, the insular cortex, central/precentral regions, subcortical and mesotemporal structures. A similar, yet less pronounced pattern of negative associations was found in analyses of CTH. In contrast, both VBM and CTH analyses yielded no signiﬁcant associations with WM performance.
Conclusions: Brain regions we found negatively associated with measures of CF and IC have been repeatedly highlighted by functional imaging studies of EF performance. The here observed inverse relationship with brain structural parameters may be related to the young age of our study population and well established neurobiological mechanisms of cortical maturation (i.e. cortical thinning via synaptic pruning and cortical myelination).},

	abstract = {In 7 experiments, the authors manipulated social exclusion by telling people that they would end up alone later in life or that other participants had rejected them. Social exclusion caused a substantial reduction in prosocial behavior. Socially excluded people donated less money to a student fund, were unwilling to volunteer for further lab experiments, were less helpful after a mishap, and cooperated less in a mixed-motive game with another student. The results did not vary by cost to the self or by recipient of the help, and results remained significant when the experimenter was unaware of condition. The effect was mediated by feelings of empathy for another person but was not mediated by mood, state self-esteem, belongingness, trust, control, or self-awareness. The implication is that rejection temporarily interferes with emotional responses, thereby impairing the capacity for empathic understanding of others, and as a result, any inclination to help or cooperate with them is undermined.},

Here, we demonstrate that a focused transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) protocol impacts activity even in deep brain areas: a subcortical brain structure, the amygdala (experiment 1), and a deep cortical region, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, experiment 2), in macaques. TUS neuromodulatory effects were measured by examining relationships between activity in each area and the rest of the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In control conditions without sonication, activity in a given area is related to activity in interconnected regions, but such relationships are reduced after sonication, speciﬁcally for the targeted areas. Dissociable and focal effects on neural activity could not be explained by auditory confounds.},

In particular, it is unclear how distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (INs) within prefrontal cortex interact and contribute to fear expression. We employed a social fear conditioning paradigm and induced robust social fear in mice. We found that social fear is characterized by activation of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and is largely diminished by dmPFC inactivation. With a combination of in vivo electrophysiological recordings and ﬁber photometry together with celltype-speciﬁc pharmacogenetics, we further demonstrated that somatostatin (SST) INs suppressed parvalbumin (PV) INs and disinhibited pyramidal cells and consequently enhanced dmPFC output to mediate social fear responses. These results reveal a previously unknown disinhibitory microcircuit in prefrontal cortex through interactions between IN subtypes and suggest that SST INs-mediated disinhibition represents an important circuit mechanism in gating social fear behavior.},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency ﬂuctuations (b0.1 Hz), observed in BOLD fMRI signal during rest, suggest the existence of underlying network dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic brain processes. Furthermore, signiﬁcant correlations between distinct anatomical regions—or functional connectivity (FC)—have led to the identiﬁcation of several widely distributed resting-state networks (RSNs). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power ﬂuctuations of local ﬁeld potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network deﬁned by empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that timedelayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity ﬂuctuations, whose patterns correlate signiﬁcantly with the empirically measured FC. The best agreement of the simulated FC with the empirically measured FC is found for a set of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated BOLD signal between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed RSNs. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the largescale structure of the brain.},

	abstract = {The aging process is accompanied by changes in the brain’s cortex at many levels. There is growing interest in summarizing these complex brain-aging profiles into a single, quantitative index that could serve as a biomarker both for characterizing individual brain health and for identifying neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Using a large-scale structural covariance network (SCN)-based framework with machine learning algorithms, we demonstrate this framework’s ability to predict individual brain age in a large sample of middle-to-late age adults, and highlight its clinical specificity for several disease populations from a network perspective. A proposed estimator with 40 SCNs could predict individual brain age, balancing between model complexity and prediction accuracy. Notably, we found that the most significant SCN for predicting brain age included the caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellar regions. Furthermore, our data indicate a larger brain age disparity in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease than in healthy controls, while this metric did not differ significantly in patients with major depressive disorder. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the estimation of brain age from a brain network perspective, and demonstrate the clinical feasibility of evaluating neurological diseases hypothesized to be associated with accelerated brain aging.},

In a cross-validation paradigm, predictor models were estimated in the training set of AD (N ϭ 81) and elderly control subjects (N ϭ 101). A combination of CSF t-tau/A␤1-4 ratio and MRI biomarkers or neuropsychological tests (free recall and trail making test B (TMT-B)) showed the best statistical ﬁt in the AD vs. HC comparison, reaching a classiﬁcation accuracy of up to 64\% when applied to the prediction of MCI conversion (3.3-year observation interval, mean ϭ 2.3 years). However, several single-predictor models showed a predictive accuracy of MCI conversion comparable to that of any multipredictor model. The best single predictors were right entorhinal cortex (prediction accuracy ϭ 68.5\% (95\% CI (59.5, 77.4))) and TMT-B test (prediction accuracy 64.6\% (95\% CI (55.5, 73.4\%))).

	abstract = {Machine learning and pattern recognition methods have been used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from individual MRI scans. Another application of such methods is to predict clinical scores from individual scans. Using relevance vector regression (RVR), we predicted individuals' performances on established tests from their MRI T1 weighted image in two independent data sets. From Mayo Clinic, 73 probable AD patients and 91 cognitively normal (CN) controls completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) within 3 months of their scan. Baseline MRI's from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) comprised the other data set; 113 AD, 351 MCI, and 122 CN subjects completed the MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive subtest (ADAS-cog) and 39 AD, 92 MCI, and 32 CN ADNI subjects completed MMSE, ADAS-cog, and AVLT. Predicted and actual clinical scores were highly correlated for the MMSE, DRS, and ADAS-cog tests (P b 0.0001). Training with one data set and testing with another demonstrated stability between data sets. DRS, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog correlated better than AVLT with whole brain grey matter changes associated with AD. This result underscores their utility for screening and tracking disease. RVR offers a novel way to measure interactions between structural changes and neuropsychological tests beyond that of univariate methods. In clinical practice, we envision using RVR to aid in diagnosis and predict clinical outcome.},

We studied the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing WM alterations in the predementia stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to DTI and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging data from 35 amyloid-β42 negative MCI subjects (MCI-Aβ42−), 35 positive MCI subjects (MCI-Aβ42+), and 25 healthy controls (HC) retrieved from the European DTI Study on Dementia. The SVM was applied to DTI-derived fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MO) maps. For comparison, we studied classification based on gray matter (GM) and WM volume. RESULTS We obtained accuracies of up to 68\% for MO and 63\% for GM volume when it came to distinguishing between MCI-Aβ42− and MCI-Aβ42+. When it came to separating MCI-Aβ42+ from HC we achieved an accuracy of up to 77\% for MD and a significantly lower accuracy of 68\% for GM volume. The accuracy of multimodal classification was not higher than the accuracy of the best single modality. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that DTI data provide better prediction accuracy than GM volume in predementia AD.},

We use classical group analyses and automated machine learning classiﬁcation of standard structural MRI scans to investigate AD diagnostic accuracy from the preclinical phase to clinical dementia. Longitudinal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were stratiﬁed into 4 groups according to the clinical statusd(1) AD patients; (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converters; (3) MCI nonconverters; and (4) healthy controlsdand submitted to a support vector machine. The obtained classiﬁer was signiﬁcantly above the chance level (62\%) for detecting AD already 4 years before conversion from MCI. Voxel-based univariate tests conﬁrmed the plausibility of our ﬁndings detecting a distributed network of hippocampal-temporoparietal atrophy in AD patients. We also identiﬁed a subgroup of control subjects with brain structure and cognitive changes highly similar to those observed in AD. Our results indicate that computational anatomy can detect AD substantially earlier than suggested by current models. The demonstrated differential spatial pattern of atrophy between correctly and incorrectly classiﬁed AD patients challenges the assumption of a uniform pathophysiological process underlying clinically identiﬁed AD.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that human brain is a complicated network and many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are related to abnormal changes of the brain network architecture. In this work, we present a kernel-based method to establish a network for each subject using mean cortical thickness, which we refer to hereafter as the individual’s network. We construct individual networks for 83 subjects, including AD patients and normal controls (NC), which are taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. The network edge features are used to make prediction of AD/NC through the sophisticated machine learning technology. As the number of edge features is much more than that of samples, feature selection is applied to avoid the adverse impact of high-dimensional data on the performance of classiﬁer. We use a hybrid feature selection that combines ﬁlter and wrapper methods, and compare the performance of six different combinations of them. Finally, support vector machines are trained using the selected features. To obtain an unbiased evaluation of our method, we use a nested cross validation framework to choose the optimal hyper-parameters of classiﬁer and evaluate the generalization of the method. We report the best accuracy of 90.4 \% using the proposed method in the leave-one-out analysis, outperforming that using the raw cortical thickness data by more than 10 \%.},

	abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging has the potential to be used as a neuroimaging marker of natural ageing and assist in elucidating trajectories of cerebral maturation and ageing. In this study, we applied a multivariate technique relevance vector regression (RVR) to predict individual subject's age using whole brain fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) from a cohort of 188 subjects aged 4–85 years. High prediction accuracy as derived from Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of actual versus predicted age (FA — r = 0.870 p b 0.0001; MD — r = 0.896 p b 0.0001; AD — r = 0.895 p b 0.0001; RD —r = 0.899 p b 0.0001) was achieved. Cerebral white-matter regions that contributed to these predictions include; corpus callosum, cingulum bundles, posterior longitudinal fasciculus and the cerebral peduncle. A post-hoc analysis of these regions showed that FA follows a nonlinear rational-quadratic trajectory across the lifespan peaking at approximately 21.8 years. The MD, RD and AD volumes were particularly useful for making predictions using grey matter cerebral regions. These results suggest that diffusion tensor imaging measurements can reliably predict individual subject's age and demonstrate that FA cerebral maturation and ageing patterns follow a non-linear trajectory with a noteworthy peaking age. These data will contribute to the understanding of neurobiology of cerebral maturation and ageing. Most notably, from a neuropsychiatric perspective our results may allow differentiation of cerebral changes that may occur due to natural maturation and ageing, and those due to developmental or neuropsychiatric disorders.},

The challenges in the study of large scale brain networks are amongst others their high dimensionality requiring signiﬁcant computational efforts, the complex connectivity across brain areas and the associated transmission delays, as well as the stochastic nature of neuronal processes. To decrease the computational effort, neurons are clustered into neural masses, which then are approximated by reduced descriptions of population dynamics. Here, we implement a neural population mode approach (Assisi et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 94(1):018106, 2005; Stefanescu and Jirsa in PLoS Comput. Biol. 4(11):e1000219, 2008), which parsimoniously captures various types of population behavior. We numerically demonstrate that the reduced population mode system favorably captures the high-dimensional dynamics of neuron networks with an architecture involving homogeneous local connectivity and a large-scale, ﬁber-like connection with time delay.},

Ostracized participants without control allocated more than four times as much sauce as any other group; ostracized participants who experienced restored control were no more aggressive than either of the groups who were included.

	abstract = {A major limitation of the approaches used in most of the studies performed so far for the characterization of the brain responses during social interaction is that only one of the participating brains is measured each time. The “interaction” between cooperating, competing or communicating brains is thus not measured directly, but inferred by independent observations aggregated by cognitive models and assumptions that link behavior and neural activation. In this paper, we use the simultaneous neuroelectric recording of several subjects engaged in cooperative games (EEG hyperscanning). This EEG hyperscanning allow us to observe and model directly the neural signature of human interactions in order to understand the cerebral processes generating and generated by social cooperation or competition. We used a paradigm called Prisoner’s dilemma derived from the game theory. Results collected in a population of 22 subjects suggested that the most consistently activated structure in social interaction paradigms is the medial prefrontal cortex, which is found to be active in all the conflict situations analyzed. The role of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) assumes a main character being a discriminant factor for the “defect” attitude of the entire population examined. This observation is compatible with the role that the Theory of Mind assigns to the ACC.},

The EEG hyperscannings have been performed with the simultaneous use of high resolution EEG devices on groups of four subjects while they were playing a card game. We estimated the concurrent activity in multiple brains of the group and we depicted the causal connections between regions of different brains. Results obtained in a study of several groups recorded by the EEG hyperscanning reveal larger activity in prefrontal and anterior cingulated cortex in different frequency bands for the player that start the game when compared to other players.

This ﬁeld still requires the accumulation of ﬁndings and establishment of analytic standards. In this study, we therefore intend to extend fNIRS-based INS research in three directions: (1) verifying the enhancement of frontopolar INS by natural and unstructured verbal communication involving more than two individuals; (2) examining timescale dependence of the INS modulation; and (3) evaluating the effects of artifact reduction methods in capturing INS. We conducted an fNIRS hyperscanning study while 12 groups of four subjects were engaged in cooperative verbal communication. Corresponding to the three objectives, our analyses of the data (1) conﬁrmed communication-enhanced frontopolar INS, as expected from the region's roles in social communication; (2) revealed the timescale dependency in the INS modulation, suggesting the merit of evaluating INS in ﬁne timescale bins; and (3) determined that removal of the skin blood ﬂow component engenders substantial improvement in sensitivity to communication-enhanced INS and segregation from artifactual synchronization, and that caution for artifact reduction preprocessing is needed to avoid excessive removal of the neural ﬂuctuation component. Accordingly, this study provides a prospective technical basis for future hyperscanning studies during daily communicative activities.},

	abstract = {Parent-child synchrony, the coupling of behavioral and biological signals during social contact, may ﬁne-tune the child's brain circuitries associated with emotional bond formation and the child's development of emotion regulation. Here, we examined the neurobiological underpinnings of these processes by measuring parent's and child's prefrontal neural activity concurrently with functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. Each child played both a cooperative and a competitive game with the parent, mostly the mother, as well as an adult stranger. During cooperation, parent's and child's brain activities synchronized in the dorsolateral prefrontal and frontopolar cortex (FPC), which was predictive for their cooperative performance in subsequent trials. No signiﬁcant brain-to-brain synchrony was observed in the conditions parent-child competition, stranger-child cooperation and stranger-child competition. Furthermore, parent-child compared to stranger-child brain-to-brain synchrony during cooperation in the FPC mediated the association between the parent's and the child's emotion regulation, as assessed by questionnaires. Thus, we conclude that brain-to-brain synchrony may represent an underlying neural mechanism of the emotional connection between parent and child, which is linked to the child's development of adaptive emotion regulation. Future studies may uncover whether brain-to-brain synchrony can serve as a neurobiological marker of the dyad's socio-emotional interaction, which is sensitive to risk conditions, and can be modiﬁed by interventions.},

	abstract = {Previous neuroscience studies have investigated neural correlates of risky decision-making in a single-brain frame during pseudo social (predominantly non face-to-face) contexts. To fully understand the risky decisionmaking behavior in more natural social interactions, the present study employed a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning technique to simultaneously measure pairs of participants' fronto-temporal activations in a face-to-face gambling card-game. The intra-brain results revealed that both those who identiﬁed as males and as females showed higher activations in their mPFC and in the inferior parts of the frontopolar area, as well as in the tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) in cases involving higher versus lower risk. This is consistent with previous ﬁndings suggesting importance of the mentalizing network in decision tasks. The fNIRS results of interbrain neural synchronization (INS) also revealed that males and females showed increased inter-brain coherence in the mPFC and dlPFC. Females, however, uniquely showed increased inter-brain coherence in the left TPJ. This INS result suggests that males may primarily depend on non-social cognitive ability to make a risky decision in a social interaction, while females may use both social and non-social cognitive abilities. The implications are also discussed for general topics of human interaction and two-person neuroscience.},

	abstract = {During a dyadic social interaction, two individuals can share visual attention through gaze, directed to each other (mutual gaze) or to a third person or an object (joint attention). Shared attention is fundamental to dyadic faceto-face interaction, but how attention is shared, retained, and neutrally represented in a pair-speciﬁc manner has not been well studied. Here, we conducted a two-day hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which pairs of participants performed a real-time mutual gaze task followed by a joint attention task on the ﬁrst day, and mutual gaze tasks several days later. The joint attention task enhanced eye-blink synchronization, which is believed to be a behavioral index of shared attention. When the same participant pairs underwent mutual gaze without joint attention on the second day, enhanced eye-blink synchronization persisted, and this was positively correlated with inter-individual neural synchronization within the right inferior frontal gyrus. Neural synchronization was also positively correlated with enhanced eye-blink synchronization during the previous joint attention task session. Consistent with the Hebbian association hypothesis, the right inferior frontal gyrus had been activated both by initiating and responding to joint attention. These results indicate that shared attention is represented and retained by pair-speciﬁc neural synchronization that cannot be reduced to the individual level.},

An effective interaction would require higher degree of cognitive involvement between the participants and consequently, an enhanced synchrony between their neural mechanisms. In this study, twelve pairs of subjects interacted with each other via a cognitively engaging experimental paradigm in which they either competed or cooperated with each other for performing a task. While they were performing the task we incorporated electroencephalographic (EEG) hyperscanning techniques by simultaneously recording the EEG activities of the interacting subjects. We quantiﬁed these interactions by computing the inter-brain synchrony (IBS) and studied the changes in IBS under different experimental conditions. We found that the inter-brain synchrony between the subjects was signiﬁcantly higher when they cooperated with each other as compared to the competitive scenario. Furthermore, we found that IBS was signiﬁcantly enhanced when the subjects were physically separated i.e. they cooperated via an intranet network. In this work, we have demonstrated how EEG hyperscanning technique can be employed to study inter-brain synchronization under different conditions.},

However, few studies have examined parent-child interbrain synchrony and whether it is associated with meaningful aspects of the parent-child relationship. Here, we measured inter-brain synchrony in the right prefrontal (PFC) and temporal cortices in mother-child dyads while they engaged in a cooperative and independent task. We tested whether inter-brain synchrony in mother-child dyads (1) increases during cooperation, (2) diﬀers in mother-son versus mother-daughter dyads, and (3) is related to cooperation performance and the attachment relationship. Overall inter-brain synchrony in the right hemisphere, and the right dorsolateral and frontopolar PFC in particular, was higher during cooperation. Mother-son dyads showed less inter-brain synchrony during the independent task and a stronger increase in synchrony in response to cooperation than mother-daughter dyads. Lastly, we did not ﬁnd strong evidence for links between inter-brain synchrony and child attachment. Mother-child cooperation may increase overall interbrain synchrony, although diﬀerently for mother-son versus mother-daughter dyads. More research is needed to better understand the potential role of overall inter-brain synchrony in mother-child cooperation, and the potential link between inter-brain synchrony and attachment.},

The implementation allows for a systematic exploration and manipulation of every underlying component of a large-scale brain network model (BNM), such as the neural mass model governing the local dynamics or the structural connectivity constraining the space time structure of the network couplings. Here, a consistent notation for the generalized BNM is given, so that in this form the equations represent a direct link between the mathematical description of BNMs and the components of the numerical implementation in TVB. Finally, we made a summary of the forward models implemented for mapping simulated neural activity (EEG, MEG, sterotactic electroencephalogram (sEEG), fMRI), identifying their advantages and limitations.},

	abstract = {Background \& new method: The widely used framework of voxel-based morphometry for analyzing neuroimages is extended here to model longitudinal imaging data by exchanging the linear model with a linear mixed-effects model. The new approach is employed for analyzing a large longitudinal sample of 756 diffusion-weighted images acquired in 177 subjects of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging initiative (ADNI).
Results and comparison with existing methods: While sample- and group-level results from both approaches are equivalent, the mixed-effect model yields information at the single subject level. Interestingly, the neurobiological relevance of the relevant parameter at the individual level describes speciﬁc differences associated with aging. In addition, our approach highlights white matter areas that reliably discriminate between patients with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy controls with a predictive power of 0.99 and include the hippocampal alveus, the para-hippocampal white matter, the white matter of the posterior cingulate, and optic tracts. In this context, notably the classiﬁer includes a sub-population of patients with minimal cognitive impairment into the pathological domain.
Conclusion: Our classiﬁer offers promising features for an accessible biomarker that predicts the risk of conversion to Alzheimer’s disease.},

Complex network analysis—a new multidisciplinary approach to the study of complex systems—aims to characterize these brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically meaningful and easily computable measures. In this article, we discuss construction of brain networks from connectivity data and describe the most commonly used network measures of structural and functional connectivity. We describe measures that variously detect functional integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural and functional network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects. Finally, we describe a Matlab toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) accompanying this article and containing a collection of complex network measures and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets.},

	abstract = {The human connectome is a topologically complex, spatially embedded network. While its topological properties have been richly characterized, the constraints imposed by its spatial embedding are poorly understood. By applying a novel resampling method to tractography data, we show that the brain's spatial embedding makes a major, but not deﬁnitive, contribution to the topology of the human connectome. We ﬁrst identify where the brain's structural hubs would likely be located if geometry was the sole determinant of brain topology. Empirical networks show a widespread shift away from this geometric center toward more peripheral interconnected skeletons in each hemisphere, with discrete clusters around the anterior insula, and the anterior and posterior midline regions of the cortex. A relatively small number of strong inter-hemispheric connections assimilate these intra-hemispheric structures into a rich club, whose connections are locally more clustered but globally longer than predicted by geometry. We also quantify the extent to which the segregation, integration, and modularity of the human brain are passively inherited from its geometry. These analyses reveal novel insights into the inﬂuence of spatial geometry on the human connectome, highlighting speciﬁc topological features that likely confer functional advantages but carry an additional metabolic cost.},

	abstract = {Superagers” are older adults who, despite their advanced age, maintain youthful memory. Previous morphometry studies revealed multiple default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions whose cortical thickness is greater in superagers and correlates with memory performance. In this study, we examined the intrinsic functional connectivity within DMN and SN in 41 young (24.5 ± 3.6 years old) and 40 older adults (66.9 ± 5.5 years old). Superaging was defined as youthful performance on a memory recall task, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and performed a separate visual–verbal recognition memory task. As predicted, within both DMN and SN, superagers had stronger connectivity compared with typical older adults and similar connectivity compared with young adults. Superagers also performed similarly to young adults and better than typical older adults on the recognition task, demonstrating youthful episodic memory that generalized across memory tasks. Stronger connectivity within each network independently predicted better performance on both the CVLT and recognition task in older adults. Variation in intrinsic connectivity explained unique variance in memory performance, above and beyond youthful neuroanatomy. These results extend our understanding of the neural basis of superaging as a model of successful aging.},

We use connectome based computational brain network modeling to reveal fundamental principles of how the human brain generates large-scale activity observable by noninvasive neuroimaging. We used structural and functional neuroimaging data to construct whole- brain models. With this novel approach, we reveal that the human brain during resting state operates at maximum metastability, i.e. in a state of maximum network switching. In addition, we investigate cortical heterogeneity across areas. Optimization of the spectral characteristics of each local brain region revealed the dynamical cortical core of the human brain, which is driving the activity of the rest of the whole brain. Brain network modelling goes beyond correlational neuroimaging analysis and reveals non-trivial network mechanisms underlying non-invasive observations. Our novel findings significantly pertain to the important role of computational connectomics in understanding principles of brain function.},

A data-driven analytic approach based on structural MR images revealed the following ﬁndings: (1) The cortical surface can be subdivided into 13 independent regions (“communities”) based on macroscopic features. (2) Thirty centers of low inter-subject variability were found in major sulci on the cortical surface. Their variability showed a strong positive correlation with the known time points at which they appear in fetal development. Centers forming early induce a higher inter-subject regularity in a larger local vicinity, while those forming later result in smaller regions of higher variability. (3) The layout of sulcal and gyral patterns within a community is governed typically by two centers. Depending on the relative variability of each center, communities can be classiﬁed into structural sub-types. (4) Sub-types across ipsi-lateral communities are independent, but associated with the subtype of the same community on the contra-lateral side. Results shown here integrate well with current knowledge about macroscopic, microscopic, and genetic determinants of brain development.},

Each surface triangle is a node of the structural connectivity graph while edges are ﬁber tract densities across pairs of nodes. Surfacebased registration and downsampling to a common surface space are introduced for group analysis whereas connectome surface smoothing aimed at improving whole-brain network estimate reliability.},

	abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space–time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

This viewpoint reflects its origins in a time when the use of single-neuron anatomical and physiological techniques was prominent. However, newer multineuronal recording methods have revealed that ensembles of neurons, rather than individual cells, can form physiological units and generate emergent functional properties and states. As a new paradigm for neuroscience, neural network models have the potential to incorporate knowledge acquired with single-neuron approaches to help us understand how emergent functional states generate behaviour, cognition and mental disease.},

	abstract = {Background: It is beneﬁcial to evaluate changes in neuroscience research ﬁeld regarding research directions and topics over a deﬁned period. Such information enables stakeholders to quickly identify the most inﬂuential research and incorporate latest evidence into research-informed education. To our knowledge, no study reported changes in neuroscience literature over the last decade. Therefore, the current study determined research terms with highest citation scores, compared publication shares of research areas and contributing countries in this ﬁeld from 2006 to 2015 and identiﬁed the most productive journals. Methods: Data were extracted from Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Only articles and reviews published in journals classiﬁed under the JCR “Neurosciences” category over the period of interest were included. Title and abstract ﬁelds of each included publication were extracted and analyzed via VOSviewer to identify recurring terms with high relative citation scores. Two term maps were produced for publications over the study period to illustrate the extent of co-occurrence, and the impact of terms was evaluated based on their relative citation scores. To further describe the recent research priority or “hot spots,” 10 terms with the highest relative citation scores were identiﬁed annually. In addition, by applying Bradford’s law, we identiﬁed 10 journals being the most productive journals per annum over the survey period and evaluated their bilbiometric performances. Results: From 2006 to 2015, there were 47 terms involved in the annual lists of top 10 terms with highest relative citation scores. The most frequently recurring terms were autism (8), meta-analysis (7), functional connectivity (6), default mode network (4) and neuroimaging (4). Neuroscience research related to psychology and behavioral sciences showed an increase in publication share over the survey period, and China has become one of the major contributors to neuroscience research. Ten journals were frequently identiﬁed (≥8 years) as core journals within the survey period. Discussion: The landscape of neuroscience research has changed recently, and this paper provides contemporary overview for researchers and health care workers interested in this ﬁeld’s research and developments. Brain imaging and brain connectivity terms had high relative citation scores.},

	abstract = {Background : It might be difﬁcult for clinicians and scientists to identify comprehensively the major research topics given the large number of publications. A bibliometric report that identiﬁes the most-cited articles within the body of the relevant literature may provide insight and guidance for readers toward scientiﬁc topics that are considered important for researchers and all relevant workers of academia. To our knowledge, there is a lack of an overall evaluation of the most-cited articles and hence of a comprehensive review of major research topics in neuroscience. The present study was therefore proposed to analyze and characterize the 100 most-cited articles in neuroscience.
Methods: Based on data provided from Web of Science, the 100 most-cited articles relevant to neuroscience were identiﬁed and characterized. Information was extracted for each included article to assess for the publication year, journal published, impact factor, adjusted impact factor, citation count (total, normalized, and adjusted), reference list, authorship and article type.
Results: The total citation count for the 100 most-cited articles ranged from 7,326 to 2,138 (mean 3087.0) and the normalized citation count ranged from 0.163 to 0.007 (mean 0.054). The majority of the 100 articles were research articles (67\%) and published from 1996 to 2000 (30\%). The author and journal with the largest share of these 100 articles were Stephen M. Smith (n = 6) and Science (n = 13) respectively. Among the 100 most-cited articles, 37 were interlinked via citations of one another, and they could be classiﬁed into ﬁve major topics, four of which were scientiﬁc topics, namely neurological disorders, prefrontal cortex/emotion/reward, brain network, and brain mapping. The remaining topic was methodology. Interestingly 41 out of 63 of the rest, non-interlinked articles could also be categorized under the above ﬁve topics. Adjusted journal impact factor among these 100 articles did not appear to be associated with the corresponding adjusted citation count.
Conclusion: The current study compiles a comprehensive list and analysis of the 100 most-cited articles relevant to neuroscience that enables the comprehensive identiﬁcation and recognition of the most important and relevant research topics concerned.},

Although bibliometric analysis can be applied to any type of publication the main focus is on journals. Five approaches to the evaluation of journal quality are identiﬁed: stated preference, citation-based, derived, hybrid, and expert panels. Different productivity, impact and hybrid metrics are used to identify rankings of tourism journals from Scopus/SCImago data, compared with a derived RAE ranking, and three expert panel rankings. The different rankings reinforces that bibliometric understanding of scientiﬁc impact is a multi-dimensional construct. However, bibliometric analysis does not occur in an institutional and policy vacuum. The institutional context of government and private organization evaluations of research quality increasingly determine which metrics are applied, with subsequent effects on performance evaluation, career development and future direction of tourism studies.},

	abstract = {Individuals exhibit considerable and unpredictable variability in painful percepts in response to the same nociceptive stimulus. Previous work has found neural responses that, while not necessarily responsible for the painful percepts themselves, can still correlate well with intensity of pain perception within a given individual. However, there is no reliable neural response reflecting the variability in pain perception across individuals. Here, we use an electrophysiological approach in humans and rodents to demonstrate that brain oscillations in the gamma band [gamma-band event-related synchronization (γ-ERS)] sampled by central electrodes reliably predict pain sensitivity across individuals. We observed a clear dissociation between the large number of neural measures that reflected subjective pain ratings at within-subject level but not across individuals, and γ-ERS, which reliably distinguished subjective ratings within the same individual but also coded pain sensitivity across different individuals. Importantly, the ability of γ-ERS to track pain sensitivity across individuals was selective because it did not track the between-subject reported intensity of nonpainful but equally salient auditory, visual, and nonnociceptive somatosensory stimuli. These results also demonstrate that graded neural activity related to within-subject variability should be minimized to accurately investigate the relationship between nociceptive-evoked neural activities and pain sensitivity across individuals.},

	abstract = {The perception of pain is highly variable. It depends on bottom-up-mediated factors like stimulus intensity and top-down-mediated factors like expectations. In the brain, pain is associated with a complex pattern of neuronal responses including evoked potentials and induced responses at alpha and gamma frequencies. Although they all covary with stimulus intensity and pain perception, responses at gamma frequencies can be particularly closely related to the perception of pain. It is, however, unclear whether this association holds true across all types of pain modulation. Here, we used electroencephalography to directly compare bottom-upand top-down-mediated modulations of pain, which were implemented by changes in stimulus intensity and placebo analgesia, respectively. The results show that stimulus intensity modulated pain-evoked potentials and pain-induced alpha and gamma responses. In contrast, placebo analgesia was associated with changes of evoked potentials, but not of alpha and gamma responses. These findings reveal that pain-related neuronal responses are differentially sensitive to bottom-up and top-down modulations of pain, indicating that they provide complementary information about pain perception. The results further show that pain-induced gamma oscillations do not invariably encode pain perception but may rather represent a marker of sensory processing whose influence on pain perception varies with behavioral context.},

We show how computations can be performed through stochastic dynamical effects, including the role of noise in enabling probabilistic jumping across barriers in the energy landscape describing the ﬂow of the dynamics in attractor networks. The results obtained in neurophysiological studies of decision-making and signal detectability are modelled by the stochastical neurodynamics of integrate-and-ﬁre networks of neurons with probabilistic neuronal spiking.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03933},
	abstract = {From spiking activity in neuronal networks to force chains in granular materials, the behavior of many real-world systems depends on a network of both strong and weak interactions. These interactions give rise to complex and higher-order system behaviors, and are encoded using data as the network's edges. However, distinguishing between true weak edges and low-weight edges caused by noise remains a challenge. We address this problem by examining the higher-order structure of noisy, weak edges added to model networks. We find that the structure of low-weight, noisy edges varies according to the topology of the model network to which it is added. By investigating this variation more closely, we see that at least three qualitative classes of noise structure emerge. Furthermore, we observe that the structure of noisy edges contains enough model-specific information to classify the model networks with moderate accuracy. Finally, we offer network generation rules that can drive different types of structure in added noisy edges. Our results demonstrate that noise does not present as a monolithic nuisance, but rather as a nuanced, topology-dependent, and even useful entity in characterizing higher-order network interactions. Hence, we provide an alternate approach to noise management by embracing its role in such interactions.},

Whereas the primary symptom of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is memory problems greater than normal for age and education, patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) show impairments in other cognitive domains in addition to memory dysfunction. Resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) studies in physiological aging indicate a global increase in low-frequency oscillations’ power and the reduction and slowing of alpha activity. The enhancement of slow and the reduction of fast oscillations, and the disruption of brain functional connectivity, however, are characterized as major rsEEG changes in AD. Recent rodent studies also support human evidence of age- and AD-related changes in resting-state brain oscillations, and the neuroprotective effect of brain stimulation techniques through gamma-band stimulations. Cumulatively, current evidence moves toward optimizing rsEEG features as reliable predictors of people with aMCI at risk for conversion to AD and mapping neural alterations subsequent to brain stimulation therapies. The present paper reviews the latest evidence of changes in rsEEG oscillations in physiological aging, aMCI, and AD, as well as findings of various brain stimulation therapies from both human and non-human studies.},

            Big data in medical diagnosis can provide abundant value for clinical diagnosis, decision support and many other applications, but obtaining a large number of labeled medical data will take a lot of time and manpower. In this paper, a classification model based on semi-supervised learning algorithm using both labeled and unlabeled data is proposed to process big data in medical diagnosis, which includes structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. For the medical laboratory data, this paper proposes a self-training algorithm based on repeated labeling strategy to solve the problem that mislabeled samples weaken the performance of classifiers. Aiming at medical record data, this paper extracts features with high correlation of classification results based on domain expert knowledge base first, and then chooses the unlabeled medical record data with the highest confidence to expand the training set and optimizes the performance of the classifiers of tri-training algorithm, which uses supervised learning algorithm to train three basic classifiers. The experimental results show that the proposed medical diagnosis data classification model based on semi-supervised learning algorithm has good performance.},

Here, we use a multi-scale neurophysiological model, “The Virtual Brain (TVB)”, based on empirical multi-modal neuroimaging data, to study how local and global dynamics correlate with individual diﬀerences in cognition. In particular, we modeled individual resting-state functional activity of 124 individuals across the behavioural spectrum from healthy aging, to amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), to AD. The model parameters required to accurately simulate empirical functional brain imaging data correlated signiﬁcantly with cognition, and exceeded the predictive capacity of empirical connectomes.},

In support of this view, Woo and colleagues present evidence that distinct brain networks support the subjective changes in pain that result from nociceptive input and self-directed cognitive modulation. This evidence for the sensitivity of distinct neural subsystems to different aspects of pain opens up the way to more formal computational network theories of pain.},

	abstract = {Living systems exhibit complex yet organized behavior on multiple spatiotemporal scales. To investigate the nature of multiscale coordination in living systems, one needs a meaningful and systematic way to quantify the complex dynamics, a challenge in both theoretical and empirical realms. The present work shows how integrating approaches from computational algebraic topology and dynamical systems may help us meet this challenge. In particular, we focus on the application of multiscale topological analysis to coordinated rhythmic processes. First, theoretical arguments are introduced as to why certain topological features and their scaledependency are highly relevant to understanding complex collective dynamics. Second, we propose a method to capture such dynamically relevant topological information using persistent homology, which allows us to effectively construct a multiscale topological portrait of rhythmic coordination. Finally, the method is put to test in detecting transitions in real data from an experiment of rhythmic coordination in ensembles of interacting humans. The recurrence plots of topological portraits highlight collective transitions in coordination patterns that were elusive to more traditional methods. This sensitivity to collective transitions would be lost if the behavioral dynamics of individuals were treated as separate degrees of freedom instead of constituents of the topology that they collectively forge. Such multiscale topological portraits highlight collective aspects of coordination patterns that are irreducible to properties of individual parts. The present work demonstrates how the analysis of multiscale coordination dynamics can benefit from topological methods, thereby paving the way for further systematic quantification of complex, high-dimensional dynamics in living systems.},

The Food Neophobia Scale (FNS) is a measure designed to assess food neophobia. However, few studies have applied the FNS in a Chinese context. Therefore, this work aims to formulate and analyze a Chinese version of the FNS (FNS-C) using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) with data gathered from a Chinese population. We examined the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the FNS-C by administering it to three samples, comprising a total of 1073 healthy Chinese college students. The ﬁrst sample (N = 408) was used to examine the structure of the FNS for Chinese participants through EFA. The second sample (N = 615) was then used to verify the scale’s factor structure through CFA. Results of the EFA suggested a three-factor model (Willingness, Trust, and Pickiness), instead of the two-factor models identiﬁed in all previous studies. The CFA results conﬁrm these ﬁndings in the second sample. The third sample (N = 50) was used to assess the test-retest reliability. The FNS-C was found to have good reliability (internal consistency and test-retest stability) and validity. In conclusion, the FNS has three factors among Chinese participants, and the FNS-C performs properly with Chinese college students.},

First, we conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify and examine the structure of the CPS. Second, the CPS’s validity and test-retest stability were investigated. The CPS was correlated with other measurements of anhedonia and pleasure experience. Furthermore, the empirical validity of CPS was also examined in our study. The results indicated that the CPS is a reliable and valid measure for assessing an individual’s hedonic capacity for smell and taste pleasure in nonclinical samples. Further application of the CPS for various populations is also discussed herein, especially for patients with mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and autism.},

	abstract = {Brain connectivity studies have revealed that highly connected ‘hub’ regions are particularly vulnerable to Alzheimer pathology: they show marked amyloid-b deposition at an early stage. Recently, excessive local neuronal activity has been shown to increase amyloid deposition. In this study we use a computational model to test the hypothesis that hub regions possess the highest level of activity and that hub vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease is due to this feature. Cortical brain regions were modeled as neural masses, each describing the average activity (spike density and spectral power) of a large number of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The large-scale network consisted of 78 neural masses, connected according to a human DTI-based cortical topology. Spike density and spectral power were positively correlated with structural and functional node degrees, confirming the high activity of hub regions, also offering a possible explanation for high resting state Default Mode Network activity. ‘Activity dependent degeneration’ (ADD) was simulated by lowering synaptic strength as a function of the spike density of the main excitatory neurons, and compared to random degeneration. Resulting structural and functional network changes were assessed with graph theoretical analysis. Effects of ADD included oscillatory slowing, loss of spectral power and long-range synchronization, hub vulnerability, and disrupted functional network topology. Observed transient increases in spike density and functional connectivity match reports in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, and may not be compensatory but pathological. In conclusion, the assumption of excessive neuronal activity leading to degeneration provides a possible explanation for hub vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease, supported by the observed relation between connectivity and activity and the reproduction of several neurophysiologic hallmarks. The insight that neuronal activity might play a causal role in Alzheimer’s disease can have implications for early detection and interventional strategies.},

Much of the neuroimaging work has focused on assessing long-range connectivity disruptions in ASD. However, evidence from both animal models and postmortem examination of the human brain suggests that local connections may also be disrupted in individuals with ASD. Here we investigated the development of local connectivity across three age cohorts of individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals. We find that in typical development, children exhibit high levels of local connectivity across the brain, while adolescents exhibit lower levels of local connectivity, similar to adult levels. On the other hand, children with ASD exhibit marginally lower local connectivity than TD children, and adolescents and adults with ASD exhibit levels of local connectivity comparable to that observed in neurotypical individuals. During all developmental stages -- childhood, adolescence, and adulthood -- individuals with ASD exhibited lower local connectivity in brain regions involved in sensory processing and higher local connectivity in brain regions involved in complex information processing. Further, higher local connectivity in ASD corresponded to more severe ASD symptomatology. Thus we demonstrate that local connectivity is disrupted in autism across development, with the most pronounced differences occurring in childhood.},

	abstract = {The brain is expensive, incurring high material and metabolic costs for its size —relative to the size of the body — and many aspects of brain network organization can be mostly explained by a parsimonious drive to minimize these costs. However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a ‘rich club’ of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.},

We examined brain network integrity in patients with neglect by measuring coherent ﬂuctuations of fMRI signals (functional connectivity). Connectivity in two largely separate attention networks located in dorsal and ventral frontoparietal areas was assessed at both acute and chronic stages of recovery. Connectivity in the ventral network, part of which directly lesioned, was diffusely disrupted and showed no recovery. In the structurally intact dorsal network, interhemispheric connectivity in posterior parietal cortex was acutely disrupted but fully recovered. This acute disruption, and disrupted connectivity in speciﬁc pathways in the ventral network, strongly correlated with impaired attentional processing across subjects. Lastly, disconnection of the white matter tracts connecting frontal and parietal cortices was associated with more severe neglect and more disrupted functional connectivity. These ﬁndings support a network view in understanding neglect.},

Neurodegenerative diseases have been thought to target these systems, but this hypothesis has not been systematically tested in living humans. We used network-sensitive neuroimaging methods to show that ﬁve different neurodegenerative syndromes cause circumscribed atrophy within ﬁve distinct, healthy, human intrinsic functional connectivity networks. We further discovered a direct link between intrinsic connectivity and gray matter structure. Across healthy individuals, nodes within each functional network exhibited tightly correlated gray matter volumes. The ﬁndings suggest that human neural networks can be deﬁned by synchronous baseline activity, a uniﬁed corticotrophic fate, and selective vulnerability to neurodegenerative illness. Future studies may clarify how these complex systems are assembled during development and undermined by disease.},

In this study we combine magneto-encephalography (MEG) and network analysis to investigate the role of functional sub-networks (modules) in the brain with regard to cognitive failure in Alzheimer's disease. Whole-head resting-state (MEG) was performed in 18 Alzheimer patients (age 67± 9, 6 females, MMSE 23± 5) and 18 healthy controls (age 66± 9, 11 females, MMSE 29± 1). We constructed functional brain networks based on interregional synchronization measurements, and performed graph theoretical analysis with a focus on modular organization. The overall modular strength and the number of modules changed signiﬁcantly in Alzheimer patients. The parietal cortex was the most highly connected network area, but showed the strongest intramodular losses. Nonetheless, weakening of intermodular connectivity was even more outspoken, and more strongly related to cognitive impairment. The results of this study demonstrate that particularly the loss of communication between different functional brain regions reﬂects cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. These ﬁndings imply the relevance of regarding dementia as a functional network disorder.},

	abstract = {The brain is a complex, nonlinear system, exhibiting ever-evolving patterns of activities even without external inputs or tasks. Such intrinsic or resting neural dynamics has been found to play critical roles in the normal functioning of the brain and psychiatric disorders. It remains a challenge, however, to link the intrinsic dynamics to the underlying structure, in part, due to the nonlinearity. Here we use a nonlinear-dynamical model to examine how the complexity of intrinsic neural dynamics, in terms of multistability and temporal diversity, is sculpted by structural properties across scales. Our model combines a population-level model (WilsonCowan) with additional biophysical constraints (from the Wong-WangDeco model). We show that multistability can emerge at the whole-brain level even when individual brain regions are by themselves monostable. The multi-functionality and memory capacity associated with multistability are thus synergistic properties of the whole-brain, irreducible to properties of its parts. The exact size of the functional repertoire and memory capacity is a joint product of the nonlinearity in the local dynamics and the topology of the large-scale network. Similarly, temporal diversity of the brain is determined by both local structural diﬀerences and the topology of the global network. Together, this work unravels an intertwined and circular relationship between local and global properties in deﬁning the intrinsic dynamic organization of the brain. Looking forward, the model can be used to probe the multiscale mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders and the eﬀective scales for treatment.},

As such, it is unlikely that an explanatory framework focused upon any single scale will yield a comprehensive theory of brain activity and cognitive function. Modelling and analysis methods for neuroscience should aim to accommodate multiscale phenomena. Emerging research now suggests that multi-scale processes in the brain arise from so-called critical phenomena that occur very broadly in the natural world. Criticality arises in complex systems perched between order and disorder, and is marked by ﬂuctuations that do not have any privileged spatial or temporal scale. We review the core nature of criticality, the evidence supporting its role in neural systems and its explanatory potential in brain health and disease.},

	abstract = {Metastability refers to the fact that the state of a dynamical system spends a large amount of time in a restricted region of its available phase space before a transition takes place, bringing the system into another state from where it might recur into the previous one. beim Graben and Hutt (2013) suggested to use the recurrence plot (RP) technique introduced by Eckmann et al. (1987) for the segmentation of system’s trajectories into metastable states using recurrence grammars. Here, we apply this recurrence structure analysis (RSA) for the ﬁrst time to resting-state brain dynamics obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain regions are deﬁned according to the brain hierarchical atlas (BHA) developed by Diez et al. (2015), and as a consequence, regions present high-connectivity in both structure (obtained from diffusion tensor imaging) and function (from the blood-level dependent-oxygenation—BOLD—signal). Remarkably, regions observed by Diez et al. were completely time-invariant. Here, in order to compare this static picture with the metastable systems dynamics obtained from the RSA segmentation, we determine the number of metastable states as a measure of complexity for all subjects and for region numbers varying from 3 to 100. We ﬁnd RSA convergence toward an optimal segmentation of 40 metastable states for normalized BOLD signals, averaged over BHA modules. Next, we build a bistable dynamics at population level by pooling 30 subjects after Hausdorff clustering. In link with this ﬁnding, we reﬂect on the different modeling frameworks that can allow for such scenarios: heteroclinic dynamics, dynamics with riddled basins of attraction, multipletimescale dynamics. Finally, we characterize the metastable states both functionally and structurally, using templates for resting state networks (RSNs) and the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas, respectively.},

Classification accuracy is one of the metric to evaluate the performance of the method. However, the SVM training and testing times increases with increasing the amounts of data in the dataset. One well known approach to reduce computational expenses of SVM is the dimensionality reduction. Most of the real time data are non- linear. In this paper, F- score analysis is used for performing dimensionality reduction for non – linear data efficiently. F- score analysis is done for datasets of insurance Bench Mark Dataset, Spam dataset, and cancer dataset. The classification Accuracy is evaluated by using confusion matrix.

	abstract = {Functional Connectivity (FC) during resting-state or task conditions is not static but inherently dynamic. Yet, there is no consensus on whether ﬂuctuations in FC may resemble isolated transitions between discrete FC states rather than continuous changes. This quarrel hampers advancing the study of dynamic FC. This is unfortunate as the structure of ﬂuctuations in FC can certainly provide more information about developmental changes, aging, and progression of pathologies. We merge the two perspectives and consider dynamic FC as an ongoing network reconﬁguration, including a stochastic exploration of the space of possible steady FC states. The statistical properties of this random walk deviate both from a purely “order-driven” dynamics, in which the mean FC is preserved, and from a purely “randomness-driven” scenario, in which ﬂuctuations of FC remain uncorrelated over time. Instead, dynamic FC has a complex structure endowed with long-range sequential correlations that give rise to transient slowing and acceleration epochs in the continuous ﬂow of reconﬁguration. Our analysis for fMRI data in healthy elderly revealed that dynamic FC tends to slow down and becomes less complex as well as more random with increasing age. These effects appear to be strongly associated with age-related changes in behavioural and cognitive performance.},

	abstract = {The ability to stop actions and thoughts is essential for goal-directed behaviour. Neuroimaging research has revealed that stopping actions and thoughts engage similar cortical mechanisms, including the ventro- and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. However, whether and how these abilities require similar subcortical mechanisms remains unexplored. Speciﬁcally of interest are the basal ganglia, subcortical structures long-known for their motor functions, but less so for their role in cognition. To investigate the potential common mechanisms in the basal ganglia underlying action and thought stopping, we conducted meta-analyses using fMRI data from the Go/No-Go, Stop-signal, and Think/No-Think tasks. All three tasks require active stopping of prepotent actions or thoughts. To localise basal ganglia activations, we performed high-resolution manual segmentations of striatal subregions. We found that all three tasks recovered clusters in the basal ganglia, although the speciﬁc localisation of these clusters diﬀered. Although the Go/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks are often interchangeably used for measuring action stopping, their cluster locations in the basal ganglia did not signiﬁcantly overlap. These different localised clusters suggest that the Go/No-Go and Stop-signal tasks may recruit distinct basal ganglia stopping processes, and therefore should not be treated equivalently. More importantly, the basal ganglia cluster recovered from the Think/No-Think task largely co-localised with that from the Stop-signal task, but not the Go/ No-Go task, possibly indicating that the Think/No-Think and Stop-signal tasks share a common striatal circuitry involved in the cancellation of unwanted thoughts and actions. The greater similarity of the Think/No-Think task to the Stop-Signal rather than Go/No-Go task also was echoed at the cortical level, which revealed highly overlapping and largely right lateralized set of regions including the anterior DLPFC, VLPFC, Pre-SMA and ACC. Overall, we provide novel evidence suggesting not only that the basal ganglia are critical for thought stopping, but also that they are involved in speciﬁc stopping subprocesses that can be engaged by tasks in diﬀerent domains. These ﬁndings raise the possibility that the basal ganglia may be part of a supramodal network responsible for stopping unwanted processes more broadly.},

	abstract = {Background: Following visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data.
Methods: We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N = 683) was randomly split into evaluation (n = 456) and validation (n = 227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment.
Results: The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 - .96), sensitivity (.97 - .99), and specificity (.85 - .94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy=.97, sensitivity = .99, specificity = .95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble.
Conclusions: We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.},

Patterns of such disease propagation are constrained by the extraordinarily complex, yet highly organized, topology of the underlying neural architecture; the so‑called connectome. Thus, network organization fundamentally influences brain disease, and a connectomic approach grounded in network science is integral to understanding neuropathology. Here, we consider how brain-network topology shapes neural responses to damage, highlighting key maladaptive processes (such as diaschisis, transneuronal degeneration and dedifferentiation), and the resources (including degeneracy and reserve) and processes (such as compensation) that enable adaptation. We then show how knowledge of network topology allows us not only to describe pathological processes but also to generate predictive models of the spread and functional consequences of brain disease.},

The model was inverted using a stochastic optimization approach, yielding markedly better fit to new, out-of-sample resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Without assuming the existence of a hierarchy, the estimated model parameters revealed a large-scale cortical gradient. At one end, sensorimotor regions had strong recurrent connections and excitatory subcortical inputs, consistent with localized processing of external stimuli. At the opposing end, default network regions had weak recurrent connections and excitatory subcortical inputs, consistent with their role in internal thought. Furthermore, recurrent connection strength and subcortical inputs provided complementary information for differentiating the levels of the hierarchy, with only the former showing strong associations with other macroscale and microscale proxies of cortical hierarchies (meta-analysis of cognitive functions, principal resting fMRI gradient, myelin, and laminar-specific neuronal density). Overall, this study provides microscale insights into a macroscale cortical hierarchy in the dynamic resting brain.},

In this study, given multimodal AD markers and clinical diagnosis of an individual from one or more timepoints, we seek to predict the clinical diagnosis, cognition and ventricular volume of the individual for every month (indeﬁnitely) into the future. We proposed and applied a minimal recurrent neural network (minimalRNN) model to data from The Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) challenge, comprising longitudinal data of 1677 participants (Marinescu et al., 2018) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We compared the performance of the minimalRNN model and four baseline algorithms up to 6 years into the future. Most previous work on predicting AD progression ignore the issue of missing data, which is a prevalent issue in longitudinal data. Here, we explored three diﬀerent strategies to handle missing data. Two of the strategies treated the missing data as a “preprocessing” issue, by imputing the missing data using the previous timepoint (“forward ﬁlling”) or linear interpolation (“linear ﬁlling). The third strategy utilized the minimalRNN model itself to ﬁll in the missing data both during training and testing (“model ﬁlling”). Our analyses suggest that the minimalRNN with “model ﬁlling” compared favorably with baseline algorithms, including support vector machine/regression, linear state space (LSS) model, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Importantly, although the training procedure utilized longitudinal data, we found that the trained minimalRNN model exhibited similar performance, when using only 1 input timepoint or 4 input timepoints, suggesting that our approach might work well with just cross-sectional data. An earlier version of our approach was ranked 5th (out of 53 entries) in the TADPOLE challenge in 2019. The current approach is ranked 2nd out of 63 entries as of June 3rd, 2020.},

We believe that there exist latent complicated patterns, e.g., non-linear relations, inherent in the low-level features. Combining latent information with the original low-level features helps build a robust model for AD/MCI classiﬁcation with high diagnostic accuracy. Using the ADNI dataset, we conducted experiments showing that the proposed method is 95.9\%, 85.0\%, and 75.8\% accurate for AD, MCI, and MCI-converter diagnosis, respectively.},

We evaluate the performance of MRI-based neuromorphometrics features (nMF) in the classiﬁcation of Healthy Controls (HC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), converters MCI (cMCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients. New methods: We propose to segregate participants in three groups according to Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSEs), searching for the main nMF in each group. Then we use them to develop a Multi Classiﬁer System (MCS). We compare the MCS against a single classiﬁer scheme using both MMSEs+nMF and nMF only. We repeat this comparison using three state-of-the-art classiﬁcation algorithms.
Results: The MCS showed the best performance on both Accuracy and Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) in comparison with single classiﬁers. The multiclass AUC for the MCS classiﬁcation on Test Dataset were 0.83 for HC, 0.76 for cMCI, 0.65 for MCI and 0.95 for AD. Furthermore, MCS’s optimum accuracy on Neurodegenerative Disease (ND) detection (AD+cMCI vs MCI+HC) was 81.0\% (AUC = 0.88), while the single classiﬁers got 71.3\% (AUC = 0.86) and 63.1\% (AUC = 0.79) for MMSEs+nMF and only nMF respectively.
Comparison with existing method: The proposed MCS showed a better performance than using all nMF into a single state-of-the-art classiﬁer.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings suggest that using cognitive scoring, e.g. MMSEs, in the design of a Multi Classiﬁer System improves performance by allowing a better selection of MRI-based features. © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

New method: We proposed to use an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs) that combined bagging without replacement and feature selection. SVM is the most commonly used algorithm in multivariate classiﬁcation of dementia, and it was therefore valuable to evaluate the potential beneﬁt of ensembling this type of classiﬁer.
Results: The ensemble SVM, using either a linear or a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, achieved multiclass classiﬁcation accuracies of 55.6\% and 55.0\% in the challenge test set (60 NC, 60 MCI, 60 cMCI, 60 AD), resulting in a third place in the challenge. Similar feature subset sizes were obtained for both kernels, and the most frequently selected MRI features were the volumes of the two hippocampal subregions left presubiculum and right subiculum. Post-challenge analysis revealed that enforcing a minimum number of selected features and increasing the number of ensemble classiﬁers improved classiﬁcation accuracy up to 59.1\%.
Comparison with existing method(s): The ensemble SVM outperformed single SVM classiﬁcations consistently in the challenge test set.

	abstract = {Background: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its onset in subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on structural MRI features is one of the most important open issues in neuroimaging. Accordingly, a scientiﬁc challenge has been promoted, on the international Kaggle platform, to assess the performance of different classiﬁcation methods for prediction of MCI and its conversion to AD. New method: This work presents a classiﬁcation strategy based on Random Forest feature selection and Deep Neural Network classiﬁcation using a mixed cohort including the four classes of classiﬁcation problem, that is HC, AD, MCI and cMCI, to train the model. Moreover, we compare this approach with a novel classiﬁcation strategy based on fuzzy logic learned on a mixed cohort including only HC and AD. Experiments: A training set of 240 subjects and a test set including mixed cohort of 500 real and simulated subjects were used. The data included AD patients, MCI subjects converting to AD (cMCI), MCI subjects and healthy controls (HC). This work ranked third for overall accuracy (38.8\%) over 19 participating teams.
Comparison with existing method(s): The “International challenge for automated prediction of MCI from MRI data” hosted by the Kaggle platform has been promoted to validate different methodologies with a common set of data and evaluation procedures.
Conclusion: DNNs reach a classiﬁcation accuracy signiﬁcantly higher than other machine learning strategies; on the other hand, fuzzy logic is particularly accurate with cMCI, suggesting a combination of these approaches could lead to interesting future perspectives.},

	abstract = {Background: AD is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease, severely impacting our society. Early diagnosis and prognosis are challenging tasks in the management of AD patients. New method: We implemented a machine-learning classiﬁer for the automatic early diagnosis and prognosis of AD by means of features extracted, selected and optimized from structural MRI brain images. The classiﬁer was designed to perform multi-label automatic classiﬁcation into the following four classes: HC, ncMCI, cMCI, and AD.
Results: From our analyses, it emerged that MMSE and hippocampus-related measures must be included as primary measures in automatic-classiﬁcation systems for both the early diagnosis and the prognosis of AD. The voting scheme mainly based on the binary-classiﬁcation performances on the different four groups is the best choice to model the multi-label decision function for AD, when compared with a simple majority-vote scheme or with a scheme aimed at discriminating patients with high vs low risk of conversion to AD and therapy addressing.
Comparison with existing method(s): The accuracies of our binary classiﬁcations were higher than or comparable to previously published methods. An improvement is needed on the approach we used to combine binary-classiﬁcation outputs to obtain the ﬁnal multi-label classiﬁcation.
Conclusions: The performance of multi-label automatic-classiﬁcation systems strongly depends on the choice of the voting scheme used for combining binary-classiﬁcation labels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Discriminating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from its prodromal form, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is a signiﬁcant clinical problem that may facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, in which a more challenging issue is to classify MCI subtypes, i.e., those who eventually convert to AD (cMCI) versus those who do not (MCI). To solve this difﬁcult 4-way classiﬁcation problem (AD, MCI, cMCI and healthy controls), a competition was hosted by Kaggle to invite the scientiﬁc community to apply their machine learning approaches on pre-processed sets of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) data and the demographic information from the international Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. This paper summarizes our competition results. We ﬁrst proposed a hierarchical process by turning the 4-way classiﬁcation into ﬁve binary classiﬁcation problems. A new feature selection technology based on relative importance was also proposed, aiming to identify a more informative and concise subset from 426 sMRI morphometric and 3 demographic features, to ensure each binary classiﬁer to achieve its highest accuracy. As a result, about 2\% of the original features were selected to build a new feature space, which can achieve the ﬁnal four-way classiﬁcation with a 54.38\% accuracy on testing data through hierarchical grouping, higher than several alternative methods in comparison. More importantly, the selected discriminative features such as hippocampal volume, parahippocampal surface area, and medial orbitofrontal thickness, etc. as well as the MMSE score, are reasonable and consistent with those reported in AD/MCI deﬁcits. In summary, the proposed method provides a new framework for multi-way classiﬁcation using hierarchical grouping and precise feature selection.},

This study aims to predict the different disease stages using brain structural information provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. New method: The neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is applied to select most powerful features for prediction. The ensemble decision tree classiﬁer is built to predict which group the subject belongs to. The best features and model parameters are determined by cross validation of the training data.
Results: Our results show that 16 out of a total of 429 features were selected by NCA using 240 training subjects, including MMSE score and structural measures in memory-related regions. The boosting tree model with NCA features can achieve prediction accuracy of 56.25\% on 160 test subjects.
Comparison with existing method(s): Principal component analysis (PCA) and sequential feature selection (SFS) are used for feature selection, while support vector machine (SVM) is used for classiﬁcation. The boosting tree model with NCA features outperforms all other combinations of feature selection and classiﬁcation methods.
Conclusions: The results suggest that NCA be a better feature selection strategy than PCA and SFS for the data used in this study. Ensemble tree classiﬁer with boosting is more powerful than SVM to predict the subject group. However, more advanced feature selection and classiﬁcation methods or additional measures besides structural MRI may be needed to improve the prediction performance.},

	abstract = {One challenge in identification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is that the number of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) is generally very small, thus difficult to train a powerful AD classifier. On the other hand, besides AD and HC subjects, we often have MR brain images available from other related subjects such as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, or possibly the unrelated subjects whose cognitive statuses may be not known. These images may be helpful for building a powerful AD classifier, although their cognitive status may not belong to AD or HC. Accordingly, in this paper, we investigate the potential of using MCI subjects to aid classification of AD from HC subjects via multimodal imaging data and CSF biomarkers. In particular, a multimodal Laplacian Regularized Least Squares (mLapRLS) method, based on semi-supervised learning, is proposed for achieving this purpose. In the objective function of mLapRLS, there are two terms: a term involving only AD and HC subjects for supervised learning, and another term involving all AD, HC, and MCI subjects for unsupervised estimation of intrinsic geometric structure of the data. Experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve AD classification, with aid from MCI subjects.},

	abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classiﬁer training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by ﬁrst learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classiﬁer. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.},

Here, we aim to identify the changes in brain networks in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and provide an accurate algorithm for classiﬁcation of these patients from healthy control subjects (HC) by using a graph theoretical approach and advanced machine learning methods. Multivariate Granger causality analysis was performed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of 34 AD, 89 MCI, and 45 HC to calculate various directed graph measures. The graph measures were used as the original feature set for the machine learning algorithm. Filter and wrapper feature selection methods were applied to the original feature set to select an optimal subset of features. An accuracy of 93.3\% was achieved for classiﬁcation of AD, MCI, and HC using the optimal features and the naïve Bayes classiﬁer. We also performed a hub node analysis and found that the number of hubs in HC, MCI, and AD were 12, 10, and 9, respectively, suggesting that patients with AD experience disturbance of critical communication areas in their brain network as AD progresses. The ﬁndings of this study provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MCI and AD. The proposed classiﬁcation method highlights the potential of directed graph measures of rs-fMRI data for identiﬁcation of the early stage of AD.},

Science is, after all, the abstraction of simple principles from complex data. The title is the ultimate refinement of the paper’s contribution. Thinking about the title early—and regularly returning to hone it—can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-toface with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in “one contribution” that is multifaceted. For example, a technology paper may describe both its new technology and a biological result using it; the bridge that unifies these two facets is a clear description of how the new technology can be used to do new biology.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have led to the proposal that patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may have disturbed functional connectivity between different brain regions. Furthermore, recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have also shown that low-frequency ({\textless}0.08 Hz) ﬂuctuations (LFF) of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signals were abnormal in several brain areas of AD patients. However, few studies have investigated disturbed LFF connectivity in AD patients. By using resting-state fMRI, this study sought to investigate the abnormal functional connectivities throughout the entire brain of early AD patients, and analyze the global distribution of these abnormalities. For this purpose, the authors divided the whole brain into 116 regions and identiﬁed abnormal connectivities by comparing the correlation coefﬁcients of each pair. Compared with healthy controls, AD patients had decreased positive correlations between the prefrontal and parietal lobes, but increased positive correlations within the prefrontal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe. The AD patients also had decreased negative correlations (closer to zero) between two intrinsically anti-correlated networks that had previously been found in the resting brain. By using resting-state fMRI, our results supported previous studies that have reported an anterior–posterior disconnection phenomenon and increased within-lobe functional connectivity in AD patients. In addition, the results also suggest that AD may disturb the correlation/anti-correlation effect in the two intrinsically anti-correlated networks. Hum Brain Mapp 28:967–978, 2007.

To date, they have generally have assumed two largely independent processes: perceptual inference, typically modelled as an approximate Bayesian process, and action control, typically modelled as a reinforcement learning process. However, inference and control are intertwined in complex ways, challenging the clarity of this distinction. Here, we consider how they may comprise a parallel hierarchical architecture that combines inference, information-seeking, and adaptive value-based control. This sheds light on the complex neural architecture of the pain system, and takes us closer to understanding from where pain ’arises’ in the brain.},

Measures were used to assess the inﬂuence of genetic similarity on structural patterning. Results indicated that: (1) Genetic eﬀects signiﬁcantly inﬂuence all structural features assessed here at all spatial resolutions, albeit at diﬀerent strengths. (2) While strong genetic eﬀects were found at the whole-brain and hemisphere level, eﬀects were weaker at the regional and vertex level, depending on the measure under study. (3) Besides cortical thickness, sulcal (geodesic) depth was found to be under strong genetic control. The local pattern indicated that two axes along (a) the anterior-posterior direction (insula to parieto-occipital sulcus), and (b) superior-inferior direction (central sulcus to callosal sulcus) presumably determine the segregation of four quadrants in each hemisphere early in development. (4) While strong structural asymmetries were found at the regional level, genetic inﬂuences on laterality were relatively minor.},

	abstract = {Low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI signal have been used to map several consistent resting state networks in the brain. Using the posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region, functional connectivity analyses have found not only positive correlations in the default mode network but negative correlations in another resting state network related to attentional processes. The interpretation is that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks. Global variations of the BOLD signal are often considered nuisance effects and are commonly removed using a general linear model (GLM) technique. This global signal regression method has been shown to introduce negative activation measures in standard fMRI analyses. The topic of this paper is whether such a correction technique could be the cause of anti-correlated resting state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Here we show that, after global signal regression, correlation values to a seed voxel must sum to a negative value. Simulations also show that small phase differences between regions can lead to spurious negative correlation values. A combination breath holding and visual task demonstrates that the relative phase of global and local signals can affect connectivity measures and that, experimentally, global signal regression leads to bell-shaped correlation value distributions, centred on zero. Finally, analyses of negatively correlated networks in resting state data show that global signal regression is most likely the cause of anti-correlations.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown altered task-based brain functioning as a result of cannabis use. To date, however, whether similar alterations in baseline resting state and functional organization of neural activity are observable in cannabis users remains unknown. We characterized global resting state cortical activations and functional connectivity via electroencephalography (EEG) in cannabis users and related these activations to measures of cannabis use. Resting state EEG in the eyes closed condition was collected from age- and sex-matched cannabis users (N ¼ 17; 6 females; mean age ¼ 30.9 Æ 7.4 years) and non-using controls (N ¼ 21; 9 females; mean age ¼ 33.1 Æ 11.6 years). Power spectral density and spectral coherence were computed to determine differences in cortical activations and connectivity between the two groups in the delta (1–4Hz), theta (4–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), and gamma (31–50 Hz) frequency bands. Cannabis users exhibited decreased delta and increased theta, beta, and gamma power compared to controls, suggesting increased cortical activation in resting state and a disinhibition of inhibitory functions that may interrupt cognitive processes. Cannabis users also exhibited increased interhemispheric and intrahemispheric coherence relative to controls, reduced mean network degree, and increased clustering coefﬁcient in speciﬁc regions and frequencies. This increased cortical activity may indicate a loss of neural reﬁnement and efﬁciency that may indicate a “noisy” brain. Lastly, measures related to cannabis use were correlated with spectral power and functional connectivity measures, indicating that speciﬁc electrophysiological signals are associated with cannabis use. These results suggest that there are differences in cortical activity and connectivity between cannabis users and non-using controls in the resting state that may be related to putative cognitive impairments and can inform effectiveness of intervention programs.},

However, optimal decision theory mandates choices be made upon the estimated validities of different information sources and little is known about whether and how people could wean themselves off social conformity bias, especially when the social signals are uninformative. Here, we asked subjects to participate in a probabilistic urn guessing task based on their private information as well as observed choices from their partners. Specifically, we manipulated the information validity of these two sources such that only the private evidence was informative. Across trials, social conformity declined, manifested by the increased influence of the private evidence but steady effect of social information. Correspondingly, we found dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was involved in detecting the conflict of private and social information and conforming to social signal whereas striatum was responsible for selectively updating the influence of private (but not social) evidence contingent on its inferred validity. Furthermore, functional coupling between striatum and dmPFC predicted the resistance toward the influence of social information. Together, these results may provide a mechanistic account of how the conformity bias toward uninformative social information can be remedied.},

	abstract = {In the research field of anxiety, previous studies generally focus on emotional responses following threat. A recent model of anxiety proposes that altered anticipation prior to uncertain threat is related with the development of anxiety. Behavioral findings have built the relationship between anxiety and distinct anticipatory processes including attention, estimation of threat, and emotional responses. However, few studies have characterized the brain organization underlying anticipation of uncertain threat and its role in anxiety. In the present study, we used an emotional anticipation paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the aforementioned topics by employing brain activation and general psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) analysis. In the activation analysis, we found that high trait anxious individuals showed significantly increased activation in the thalamus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), as well as decreased activation in the precuneus, during anticipation of uncertain threat compared to the certain condition. In the gPPI analysis, the key regions including the amygdala, dmPFC, and precuneus showed altered connections with distributed brain areas including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), insula, para-hippocampus gyrus (PHA), thalamus, and MTG involved in anticipation of uncertain threat in anxious individuals. Taken together, our findings indicate that during the anticipation of uncertain threat, anxious individuals showed altered activations and functional connectivity in widely distributed brain areas, which may be critical for abnormal perception, estimation, and emotion reactions during the anticipation of uncertain threat.},

Despite a surge of interest in examining behavioral characteristics of narcissism in the past decades, the neurobiological substrates underlying narcissism remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this issue by applying a machine learning approach to decode trait narcissism from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired for a large sample comprising 155 healthy adults, each of whom was assessed for trait narcissism. Using a linear prediction model, we examined the relationship between whole-brain RSFC and trait narcissism. We demonstrated that the machine-learning model was able to decode individual trait narcissism from RSFC across multiple neural systems, including functional connectivity between and within limbic and prefrontal systems as well as their connectivity with other networks. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model included the amygdala, prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions that have been linked to trait narcissism. These findings remained robust using different validation procedures. Our findings thus demonstrate that RSFC among multiple neural systems predicts trait narcissism at the individual level.},

	abstract = {Social comparison is ubiquitous across human societies with dramatic inﬂuence on people’s well-being and decision making. Downward comparison (comparing to worse-off others) and upward comparison (comparing to better-off others) constitute two types of social comparisons that produce different neuropsychological consequences. Based on studies exploring neural signatures associated with downward and upward comparisons, the current study utilized a coordinate-based meta-analysis to provide a reﬁnement of understanding about the underlying neural architecture of social comparison. We identiﬁed consistent involvement of the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in downward comparison and consistent involvement of the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in upward comparison. These ﬁndings ﬁt well with the “common-currency” hypothesis that neural representations of social gain or loss resemble those for non-social reward or loss processing. Accordingly, we discussed our ﬁndings in the framework of general reinforcement learning (RL) hypothesis, arguing how social gain/loss induced by social comparisons could be encoded by the brain as a domain-general signal (i.e., prediction errors) serving to adjust people’s decisions in social settings. Although the RL account may serve as a heuristic framework for the future research, other plausible accounts on the neuropsychological mechanism of social comparison were also acknowledged.

However, the exact neuroanatomical substrate for social well-being remains unclear. To address the issue, we employed the voxel-based morphometry method to probe the neuroanatomical basis of individual variation in social well-being in young healthy adults (n = 136). The results revealed a significant negative association between social well-being and regional gray matter density (rGMD) in an anatomical cluster that mainly includes the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that has been involved in emotion regulation and social cognition. Furthermore, a balanced 4-fold cross-validation using the machine learning approach revealed that rGMD in the left OFC could be reliably related to social well-being. More importantly, the multiple mediation analysis revealed that neuroticism and dispositional forgiveness independently mediated the association between rGMD in the left OFC and social well-being. In addition, all these results remained stable when subjective socioeconomic status was controlled. Together, our results provide the initial evidence that the OFC is a neuroanatomical substrate for social well-being and demonstrate that the OFC is a crucial neural site linking neuroticism and dispositional forgiveness to social well-being.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies showed that resting state activity in the healthy brain is organized into multiple large-scale networks encompassing distant regions. A key ﬁnding of resting state fMRI studies is the anti-correlation typically observed between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN), which—during task performance—are activated and deactivated, respectively. Previous studies have suggested that alcohol administration modulates the balance of activation/deactivation in brain networks, as well as it induces signiﬁcant changes in oscillatory activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). However, our knowledge of alcoholinduced changes in band-limited EEG power and their potential link with the functional interactions between DAN and DMN is still very limited. Here we address this issue, examining the neuronal effects of alcohol administration during resting state by using simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Our ﬁndings show increased EEG power in the theta frequency band (4–8 Hz) after administration of alcohol compared to placebo, which was prominent over the frontal cortex. More interestingly, increased frontal tonic EEG activity in this band was associated with greater anti-correlation between the DAN and the frontal component of the DMN. Furthermore, EEG theta power and DAN-DMN anti-correlation were relatively greater in subjects who reported a feeling of euphoria after alcohol administration, which may result from a diminished inhibition exerted by the prefrontal cortex. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that slow brain rhythms are responsible for dynamic functional interactions between brain networks. They also conﬁrm the applicability and potential usefulness of EEG-fMRI for central nervous system drug research. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3517–3528, 2014. VC 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

An instrument developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity is the 14-item, self-report, Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale, but its psychometric properties have not been adequately evaluated. The current study examined the reliability and validity of the SHAPS using a large sample of adult outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Data for the current study were obtained from 461 adult outpatients with a diagnosis of MDD who participated in Project IMPACTS. Internal consistency of the SHAPS was assessed using Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. A Principal Factor Analysis was used to define the dimensionality of the SHAPS. Convergent and discriminant validity was assessed by evaluating the Pearson correlations between the SHAPS total score and the pleasure/ enjoyment item of the IDS-C30, QLES-Q, HRSD17, IDS-C30, QIDS-C16, and MADRS10, respectively. The internal consistency of the SHAPS was .91. A one-factor solution emerged for the SHAPS (eigenvalues of the first two initial factors were 5.95 and 0.43, respectively). Pearson correlations revealed a positive linear relationship between the SHAPS total score and the total scores on the HRSD17 (r = .49, p{\textless}.0001), IDS-C30 (r = .56, p{\textless}.0001), QIDS-C16 (r = .55, p{\textless}.0001), and MADRS10 (r = .53, p{\textless}.0001). The SHAPS total score was negatively correlated with the QLES-Q (r = -0.65, p{\textless}.0001). The current study shows that the SHAPS is a reliable, valid, and unidimensional instrument to assess hedonic capacity in adult outpatients with MDD.},

Past research has revealed that people respond to social exclusion, rejection, and ostracism with both prosocial and antisocial behavior (e.g., mimicry vs. aggression), as well as both enhanced and impaired cognitive functioning (e.g., improved social memory vs. impaired logic). We adopt an evolutionary perspective and propose that all these disparate outcomes can be explained as a result of the provision of resources toward goal-relevant processes and the diversion of resources away from goal-irrelevant processes. In this article, we introduce our theory, review past research ﬁndings in light of the theory, and propose novel hypotheses derived from a resource redistribution account.},

	abstract = {During social interactions, each individual’s actions are simultaneously a consequence of and an antecedent to their interaction partner’s behavior. Capturing online the brain processes underlying such mutual dependency requires simultaneous measurements of all interactants’ brains during real-world exchange (‘hyperscanning’). This demands a precise characterization of the type of interaction under investigation, however, and analytical techniques capable of capturing interpersonal dependencies. We adapted an interactive task capable of dissociating between two dimensions of interdependent social exchange: goal structure (cooperation vs competition) and interaction structure [concurrent (CN) vs turn-based]. Performing dual-functional magnetic resonance imaging hyperscanning on pairs of individuals interacting on this task, and modeling brain responses in both interactants as systematic reactions to their partner’s behavior, we investigated interpersonal brain-behavior dependencies (iBBDs) during each dimension. This revealed patterns of iBBDs that differentiated among exchanges; in players supporting the actions of another, greater brain responses to the co-player’s actions were expressed in regions implicated in social cognition, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and temporal cortices. Stronger iBBD during CN competitive exchanges was observed in brain systems involved in movement planning and updating, however, such as the supplementary motor area. This demonstrates the potential for hyperscanning to elucidate neural processes underlying different forms of social exchange.},

This selection was made either randomly by a computer (i.e. random pairing mode) or by the proposer (i.e. choice mode), based on physical appearance. Being chosen by the proposer triggered positive reciprocal behavior in participants, who accepted unfair offers more frequently than when they had been selected by the computer. Independently of selection mode, greater P200 amplitudes were found when participants received fair offers than when they received unfair offers and when unfair shares were offered to their rivals rather than to them, suggesting that receiving fair offers or observing a rival’s misfortune was rewarding for participants. While participants generally showed more interest in the offers they themselves received (i.e. greater P300 responses to these offers), observing their rivals receive fair shares after the latter had been chosen by the proposer triggered an increase in P300 amplitude likely to ref lect a feeling of envy. This study provides new insights into both the cognitive and affective processes underpinning economic decision making in a context of social inclusion/exclusion.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies in social neuroscience have largely relied on functional connectivity (FC) methods to characterize the functional integration between different brain regions. However, these methods have limited utility in social-cognitive studies that aim to understand the directed information flow among brain areas that underlies complex psychological processes. In this study we combined functional and effective connectivity approaches to characterize the functional integration within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and its role in self-perceived empathy. Forty-two participants underwent a resting state fMRI scan and completed a questionnaire of dyadic empathy. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) showed that higher empathy scores were associated with an increased contribution of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the DMN spatial mode. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) combined with Canonical Variance Analysis (CVA) revealed that this association was mediated indirectly by the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) via the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). More specifically, in participants with higher scores in empathy, the PCC had a greater effect on bilateral IPL and the right IPL had a greater influence on mPFC. These results highlight the importance of using analytic approaches that address directed and hierarchical connectivity within networks, when studying complex psychological phenomena, such as empathy.},

Current evidence for sleep learning in humans is inconclusive. To explore conditions under which verbal learning might occur, we hypothesized that peaks of slow waves would be conducive to verbal learning because the peaks deﬁne periods of neural excitability. While in slow-wave sleep during a nap, a series of word pairs comprising pseudowords, e.g., ‘‘tofer,’’ and actual German words, e.g., ‘‘Haus’’ (house), were played to young German-speaking women and men. When the presentation of the second word of a pair (e.g., ‘‘Haus’’ of ‘‘tofer-house’’) coincided with an ongoing slow-wave peak, the chances increased that a new semantic association between the pair had been formed and retained. Sleep-formed associations translated into awake ones, where they guided forced choices on an implicit memory test. Reactivations of sleep-formed associations were mirrored by brain activation increases measured with fMRI in cortical language areas and the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for relational binding. We infer that implicit relational binding had occurred during peaks of slow oscillations, recruiting a hippocampal-neocortical network comparable to vocabulary learning in the waking state.},

While VPT is often described as a quasi-perceptual phenomenon [5, 6], evidence for this proposal has been lacking. Here, we provide direct evidence that another’s perspective can ‘‘stand in’’ for one’s own sensory input during perceptual decision making. In a variant of the classic mental rotation task, participants judged whether characters presented in different orientations were canonical or mirror inverted. In the absence of another person, we replicate the wellestablished positive linear relationship between recognition times and angle of orientation such that recognition becomes slower the more an item has to be mentally rotated into its canonical orientation [7]. Importantly, this relationship was disrupted simply by placing another individual in the scene. Items rotated away from the participant were recognized more rapidly the closer they appeared in their canonical orientation, not only to the participant, but also to this other individual, showing that another’s visual perspective drives mental rotation and item recognition in a similar way as one’s own visual perspective. The effects were large and replicated in the three independent studies. They were observed even when the other person was completely passive, enhanced when the participant was explicitly instructed to take the other person’s perspective, but reduced when the persons in the scenes were replaced with objects. The content of another’s perspective is therefore spontaneously derived, takes a quasi-perceptual form, and can stand in for one’s own sensory input during perceptual decision making.},

	abstract = {Loneliness (i.e., feeling alone) and social isolation (i.e., being alone) are among the most robust known risk factors for poor health and accelerated mortality. Yet mitigating these social risk factors is challenging, as few interventions have been effective for both reducing loneliness and increasing social contact. Mindfulness interventions, which train skills in monitoring present-moment experiences with an orientation of acceptance, have shown promise for improving social-relationship processes. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a 2-wk smartphone-based mindfulness training for reducing loneliness and increasing social contact in daily life. Importantly, this study shows that developing an orientation of acceptance toward present-moment experiences is a critical mechanism for mitigating these social risk factors.Loneliness and social isolation are a growing public health concern, yet there are few evidence-based interventions for mitigating these social risk factors. Accumulating evidence suggests that mindfulness interventions can improve social-relationship processes. However, the active ingredients of mindfulness training underlying these improvements are unclear. Developing mindfulness-specific skills—namely, (i) monitoring present-moment experiences with (ii) an orientation of acceptance—may change the way people perceive and relate toward others. We predicted that developing openness and acceptance toward present experiences is critical for reducing loneliness and increasing social contact and that removing acceptance-skills training from a mindfulness intervention would eliminate these benefits. In this dismantling trial, 153 community adults were randomly assigned to a 14-lesson smartphone-based intervention: (i) training in both monitoring and acceptance (Monitor+Accept), (ii) training in monitoring only (Monitor Only), or (iii) active control training. For 3 d before and after the intervention, ambulatory assessments were used to measure loneliness and social contact in daily life. Consistent with predictions, Monitor+Accept training reduced daily-life loneliness by 22\% (d = 0.44, P = 0.0001) and increased social contact by two more interactions each day (d = 0.47, P = 0.001) and one more person each day (d = 0.39, P = 0.004), compared with both Monitor Only and control trainings. These findings describe a behavioral therapeutic target for improving social-relationship functioning; by fostering equanimity with feelings of loneliness and social disconnect, acceptance-skills training may allow loneliness to dissipate and encourage greater engagement with others in daily life.},

Indeed, many of us go to great lengths to avoid situations that may engender these experiences (such as public speaking). Why is it that these negative social experiences have such a profound effect on our emotional well-being? Emerging evidence suggests that experiences of social pain —the painful feelings associated with social disconnection — rely on some of the same neurobiological substrates that underlie experiences of physical pain. Understanding the ways in which physical and social pain overlap may provide new insights into the surprising relationship between these two types of experiences.},

However, few studies have examined the structure of the measure in non-Western samples. The current study aimed to evaluate the factor structure and psychometric properties of the TEPS in a Chinese sample.
Methods: We administered the Chinese version of the TEPS to 2275 healthy Chinese college students. They were randomly split into two sub-samples. The first sub-sample was used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the structure of the TEPS in a Chinese sample. The second sub-sample was used as a validation sample for the identified structure from the EFA and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was adopted.
Results: Results of the EFA suggested a four-factor model (consummatory contextual, consummatory abstract, anticipatory contextual, and anticipatory abstract factors) instead of the original two-factor model (consummatory and anticipatory factors) ascertained from Western samples in the United States. The CFA results confirmed these results in the second subsample. Internal consistency and test-retest stability of the TEPS factors were good.
Conclusions: The TEPS has four factors among Chinese participants. Possible reasons for cultural difference and potential applications of the TEPS for cross-cultural comparison are discussed.},

To the extent that these pain processes overlap, acetaminophen, a physical pain suppressant that acts through central (rather than peripheral) neural mechanisms, may also reduce behavioral and neural responses to social rejection. In two experiments, participants took acetaminophen or placebo daily for 3 weeks. Doses of acetaminophen reduced reports of social pain on a daily basis (Experiment 1). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure participants’ brain activity (Experiment 2), and found that acetaminophen reduced neural responses to social rejection in brain regions previously associated with distress caused by social pain and the affective component of physical pain (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Thus, acetaminophen reduces behavioral and neural responses associated with the pain of social rejection, demonstrating substantial overlap between social and physical pain.},

            Recent critical commentaries unfavorably compare deep learning (DL) with standard machine learning (SML) approaches for brain imaging data analysis. However, their conclusions are often based on pre-engineered features depriving DL of its main advantage — representation learning. We conduct a large-scale systematic comparison profiled in multiple classification and regression tasks on structural MRI images and show the importance of representation learning for DL. Results show that if trained following prevalent DL practices, DL methods have the potential to scale particularly well and substantially improve compared to SML methods, while also presenting a lower asymptotic complexity in relative computational time, despite being more complex. We also demonstrate that DL embeddings span comprehensible task-specific projection spectra and that DL consistently localizes task-discriminative brain biomarkers. Our findings highlight the presence of nonlinearities in neuroimaging data that DL can exploit to generate superior task-discriminative representations for characterizing the human brain.},

	abstract = {Background: The unparalleled performance of deep learning approaches in generic image processing has motivated its extension to neuroimaging data. These approaches learn abstract neuroanatomical and functional brain alterations that could enable exceptional performance in classiﬁcation of brain disorders, predicting disease progression, and localizing brain abnormalities. New Method: This work investigates the suitability of a modiﬁed form of deep residual neural networks (ResNet) for studying neuroimaging data in the speciﬁc application of predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Prediction was conducted ﬁrst by training the deep models using MCI individuals only, followed by a domain transfer learning version that additionally trained on AD and controls. We also demonstrate a network occlusion based method to localize abnormalities.
Results: The implemented framework captured non-linear features that successfully predicted AD progression and also conformed to the spectrum of various clinical scores. In a repeated cross-validated setup, the learnt predictive models showed highly similar peak activations that corresponded to previous AD reports.
Comparison with existing methods: The implemented architecture achieved a signiﬁcant performance improvement over the classical support vector machine and the stacked autoencoder frameworks (p {\textless} 0.005), numerically better than state-of-the-art performance using sMRI data alone ({\textgreater} 7\% than the second-best performing method) and within 1\% of the state-of-the-art performance considering learning using multiple neuroimaging modalities as well.
Conclusions: The explored frameworks reﬂected the high potential of deep learning architectures in learning subtle predictive features and utility in critical applications such as predicting and understanding disease progression.},

	abstract = {Understanding the correlation structure associated with multiple brain measurements informs about potential “functional groupings” and network organization. The correlation structure can be conveniently captured in a matrix format that summarizes the relationships among a set of brain measurements involving two regions, for example. Such functional connectivity matrix is an important component of many types of investigation focusing on network-level properties of the brain, including clustering brain states, characterizing dynamic functional states, performing participant identiﬁcation (so-called “ﬁngerprinting”) understanding how tasks reconﬁgure brain networks, and inter-subject correlation analysis. In these investigations, some notion of proximity or similarity of functional connectivity matrices is employed, such as their Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation (by correlating the matrix entries). Here, we propose the use of a geodesic distance metric that reﬂects the underlying non-Euclidean geometry of functional correlation matrices. The approach is evaluated in the context of participant identiﬁcation (ﬁngerprinting): given a participant’s functional connectivity matrix based on resting-state or task data, how effectively can the participant be identiﬁed? Using geodesic distance, identiﬁcation accuracy was over 95\% on resting-state data, and exceeded the Pearson correlation approach by 20\%. For whole-cortex regions, accuracy improved on a range of tasks by between 2\% and as much as 20\%. We also investigated identiﬁcation using pairs of subnetworks (say, dorsal attention plus default mode), and particular combinations improved accuracy over whole-cortex participant identiﬁcation by over 10\%. The geodesic distance also outperformed Pearson correlation when the former employed a fourth of the data as the latter. Finally, we suggest that low-dimensional distance visualizations based on the geodesic approach help uncover the geometry of task functional connectivity in relation to that during resting-state. We propose that the use of the geodesic distance is an effective way to compare the correlation structure of the brain across a broad range of studies.},

In the present review, we discuss candidate contributing factors leading to AD, and evaluate novel computational brain simulation methods to further disentangle their potential roles. We first present an overview of existing computational models for AD that aim to provide a mechanistic understanding of the disease. Next, we outline the potential to link molecular aspects of neurodegeneration in AD with large-scale brain network modeling using The Virtual Brain (

	abstract = {The BOLD fMRI response in the cortex is often assumed to ref lect changes in excitatory neural activity. However, the contribution of inhibitory neurons to BOLD fMRI is unclear. Here, the role of inhibitory and excitatory activity was examined using multimodal approaches: electrophysiological recording, 15.2 T fMRI, optical intrinsic signal imaging, and modeling. Inhibitory and excitatory neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex were selectively modulated by 20-s optogenetic stimulation of VGAT-ChR2 and CaMKII-ChR2 mice, respectively. Somatosensory stimulation and optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons induced positive BOLD responses in the somatosensory network, whereas stimulation of inhibitory neurons produced biphasic responses at the stimulation site, initial positive and later negative BOLD signals, and negative BOLD responses at downstream sites. When the stimulation duration was reduced to 5 s, the hemodynamic response of VGAT-ChR2 mice to optogenetic stimulation was only positive. Lastly, modeling performed from neuronal and hemodynamic data shows that the hemodynamic response function (HRF) of excitatory neurons is similar across different conditions, whereas the HRF of inhibitory neurons is highly sensitive to stimulation frequency and peaks earlier than that of excitatory neurons. Our study provides insights into the neurovascular coupling of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and the interpretation of BOLD fMRI signals.},

We used a computational algorithm, hyperalignment, to resolve these topographic idiosyncrasies and found that predictions of general intelligence based on fine-grained (vertex-by-vertex) connectivity patterns were markedly stronger than predictions based on coarse-grained (region-by-region) patterns. Intelligence was best predicted by fine-grained connectivity in the default and frontoparietal cortical systems, both of which are associated with self-generated thought. Previous work overlooked fine-grained architecture because existing methods could not resolve idiosyncratic topographies, preventing investigation where the keys to the neural basis of intelligence are more likely to be found.},

            Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are associated with progressive brain disorganization. Although structural asymmetry is an organizing feature of the cerebral cortex it is unknown whether continuous age- and AD-related cortical degradation alters cortical asymmetry. Here, in multiple longitudinal adult lifespan cohorts we show that higher-order cortical regions exhibiting pronounced asymmetry at age {\textasciitilde}20 also show progressive asymmetry-loss across the adult lifespan. Hence, accelerated thinning of the (previously) thicker homotopic hemisphere is a feature of aging. This organizational principle showed high consistency across cohorts in the Lifebrain consortium, and both the topological patterns and temporal dynamics of asymmetry-loss were markedly similar across replicating samples. Asymmetry-change was further accelerated in AD. Results suggest a system-wide dedifferentiation of the adaptive asymmetric organization of heteromodal cortex in aging and AD.},

            Our ability to manipulate the behavior of complex networks depends on the design of efficient control algorithms and, critically, on the availability of an accurate and tractable model of the network dynamics. While the design of control algorithms for network systems has seen notable advances in the past few years, knowledge of the network dynamics is a ubiquitous assumption that is difficult to satisfy in practice. In this paper we overcome this limitation, and develop a data-driven framework to control a complex network optimally and without any knowledge of the network dynamics. Our optimal controls are constructed using a finite set of data, where the unknown network is stimulated with arbitrary and possibly random inputs. Although our controls are provably correct for networks with linear dynamics, we also characterize their performance against noisy data and in the presence of nonlinear dynamics, as they arise in power grid and brain networks.},

TVB is also accessible as a standalone cross-platform Python library and application, and users can interact with the scientiﬁc core through the scripting interface IDLE, enabling easy modeling, development and debugging of the scientiﬁc kernel. This second interface makes TVB extensible by combining it with other libraries and modules developed by the Python scientiﬁc community.

Apart from traditional efforts to reproduce brain dynamics from the micro- to macroscopic scales, complementary approaches develop phenomenological models of lower complexity. Such macroscopic models typically generate only a few selected—ideally functionally relevant—aspects of the brain dynamics. Importantly, they often allow an understanding of the underlying mechanisms beyond computational reproduction. Adding detail to these models will widen their ability to reproduce a broader range of dynamic features of the brain. For instance, such models allow for the exploration of consequences of focal and distributed pathological changes in the system, enabling us to identify and develop approaches to counteract those unfavorable processes. Toward this end, The Virtual Brain (TVB) (www.thevirtualbrain.org), a neuroinformatics platform with a brain simulator that incorporates a range of neuronal models and dynamics at its core, has been developed. This integrated framework allows the modelbased simulation, analysis, and inference of neurophysiological mechanisms over several brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals.

              Activity cascades are found in many complex systems. In the cortex, they arise in the form of neuronal avalanches that capture ongoing and evoked neuronal activities at many spatial and temporal scales. The scale-invariant nature of avalanches suggests that the brain is in a critical state, yet predictions from critical theory on the temporal unfolding of avalanches have yet to be confirmed
              in vivo
              . Here we show in awake nonhuman primates that the temporal profile of avalanches follows a symmetrical, inverted parabola spanning up to hundreds of milliseconds. This parabola constrains how avalanches initiate locally, extend spatially and shrink as they evolve in time. Importantly, parabolas of different durations can be collapsed with a scaling exponent close to 2 supporting critical generational models of neuronal avalanches. Spontaneously emerging, transient γ–oscillations coexist with and modulate these avalanche parabolas thereby providing a temporal segmentation to inherently scale-invariant, critical dynamics. Our results identify avalanches and oscillations as dual principles in the temporal organization of brain activity.},

However, little is known about the alterations of interhemispheric functional interactions and underlying structural connectivity in the AD patients. In this study, we combined resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate interhemispheric functional and structural connectivity in 16 AD, 16 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as 16 cognitive normal healthy subjects (CN). The pattern of the resting state interhemispheric functional connectivity was measured with a voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method. Decreased VMHC was observed in AD and MCI subjects in anterior brain regions including the prefrontal cortices and subcortical regions with a pattern of AD{\textless}MCI{\textless}CN. Increased VMHC was observed in MCI subjects in posterior brain regions with patterns of AD/CN {\textless} MCI (sensorimotor cortex) and AD {\textless} CN/MCI (occipital gyrus). DTI analysis showed the most significant difference among the three cohorts was the fractional anisotropy in the genu of corpus callosum, which was positively associated with the VMHC of prefrontal and subcortical regions. Across all the three cohorts, the diffusion parameters in the genu of corpus callosum and VMHC in the above brain regions had significant correlation with the cognitive performance. These results demonstrate that there are specific patterns of interhemispheric functional connectivity changes in the AD and MCI, which can be significantly correlated with the integrity changes in the midline white matter structures. These results suggest that VMHC can be used as a biomarker for the degeneration of the interhemispheric connectivity in AD.},

Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that patients with EOAD present more atrophy and functional disconnection than LOAD patients. However, it remains unknown whether the interhemispheric functional disconnection or its underlying structural impairment contributes to the different clinical proﬁles of EOAD and LOAD.
Methods: According to the arbitrary cut-off age of 65, we included 22 EOAD patients, 27 LOAD patients and 38 healthy controls (further divided into 21 relatively young and 17 old controls). Participants underwent resting-state functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. We used voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) to examine interhemispheric functional connectivity. Then, we calculated the diffusion index based on tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Two-sample t-tests were used to assess the interhemispheric connectivity differences between each patient group and its corresponding control group.
Results: We found that the EOAD patients had lower VMHC in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and inferior parietal cortex (IPC) than did controls. Consistently, the EOAD patients exhibited white matter (WM) tract impairment in the posterior regions. On the other hand, the LOAD patients displayed increased VMHC and impaired WM tracts in the frontal region. Correlation analyses showed that VMHC in the IPC was related to executive function in the EOAD patients (r = −0.67, P {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusion: In contrast to the LOAD patients, patients with EOAD exhibited more widely disrupted interhemispheric functional and structural connectivity, which overlapped well across brain regions. In addition, for the EOAD patients, decreased interhemispheric connectivity related to executive deﬁcits. Our study suggested that different interhemispheric connectivity damage patterns may contribute to the distinct clinical proﬁles in EOAD and LOAD.},

One hypothesized consequence of this pathology is that AD patients should be disproportionally impaired on measures of interhemispheric transfer. However, there is a paucity of studies bearing on this prediction. We report the results from two measures of interhemispheric interaction obtained from healthy younger and older adults, and older adults with probable AD. One measure examined speeded simple manual responses to a lateralized light ﬂash (i.e., the Poffenberger task) and the other examined the interhemispheric coordination of computational resources using within and across hemiﬁeld variants of visual letter-matching tasks. AD patients show an overall impairment of performance on both intra and interhemispheric conditions in all tasks. However, there is no indication of disproportionate alteration of interhemispheric processes mediating either visuomotor transfer or visual letter-matching and the allocation of computational resources. The results, therefore, call into question the appropriateness of a “split-brain” model for AD, at least in the domain of visual processing. Although the results are not speciﬁcally diagnostic of a disconnection syndrome, they are consistent with the possibility of a breakdown of cortico-cortical connectivity both within and between the hemispheres in AD.},

            Using The Virtual Brain (TVB,
            thevirtualbrian.org
            ) simulation platform, we explored for 50 individual adult human brains (ages 18-80), how personalized connectome based brain network modelling captures various empirical observations as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). We compare simulated activity based on individual structural connectomes (SC) inferred from diffusion weighted imaging with fMRI and EEG in the resting state. We systematically explore the role of the following model parameters: conduction velocity, global coupling and graph theoretical features of individual SC. First, a subspace of the parameter space is identified for each subject that results in realistic brain activity, i.e. reproducing the following prominent features of empirical EEG-fMRI activity: topology of resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), functional connectivity dynamics (FCD), electrophysiological oscillations in the delta (3-4 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range and their bimodality, i.e. low and high energy modes. Interestingly, FCD fit, bimodality and static FC fit are highly correlated. They all show their optimum in the same range of global coupling. In other words, only when our local model is in a bistable regime we are able to generate switching of modes in our global network. Second, our simulations reveal the explicit network mechanisms that lead to electrophysiological oscillations, their bimodal behaviour and inter-regional differences. Third, we discuss biological interpretability of the Stefanescu-Jirsa-Hindmarsh-Rose-3D model when embedded inside the large-scale brain network and mechanisms underlying the emergence of bimodality of the neural signal.
          
          With the present study, we set the cornerstone for a systematic catalogue of spatiotemporal brain activity regimes generated with the connectome-based brain simulation platform The Virtual Brain.
          
            Author Summary
            In order to understand brain dynamics we use numerical simulations of brain network models. Combining the structural backbone of the brain, that is the white matter fibres connecting distinct regions in the grey matter, with dynamical systems describing the activity of neural populations we are able to simulate brain function on a large scale. In order to make accurate prediction with this network, it is crucial to determine optimal model parameters. We here use an explorative approach to adjust model parameters to individual brain activity, showing that subjects have their own optimal point in the parameter space, depending on their brain structure and function. At the same time, we investigate the relation between bistable phenomena on the scale of neural populations and the changed in functional connectivity on the brain network scale. Our results are important for future modelling approaches trying to make accurate predictions of brain function.},

Newborn neurons must assemble into circuits producing activity patterns capable of instructing behaviors. Elucidating how this process is coordinated requires new methods that follow maturation and activity of all cells across a developing circuit. We present an imaging method for comprehensively tracking neuron lineages, movements, molecular identities, and activity in the entire developing zebraﬁsh spinal cord, from neurogenesis until the emergence of patterned activity instructing the earliest spontaneous motor behavior. We found that motoneurons are active ﬁrst and form local patterned ensembles with neighboring neurons. These ensembles merge, synchronize globally after reaching a threshold size, and ﬁnally recruit commissural interneurons to orchestrate the left-right alternating patterns important for locomotion in vertebrates. Individual neurons undergo functional maturation stereotypically based on their birth time and anatomical origin. Our study provides a general strategy for reconstructing how functioning circuits emerge during embryogenesis.},

The pathological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common neurodegenerative disease, remain largely unknown. Altered brain laterality has been demonstrated in aging people, but whether or not abnormal lateralization is one of the early signs of AD has not been determined. To investigate this, we recorded bilateral LFPs in 3-5-month-old AD model mice, APP/PS1, together with littermate wild type (WT) controls. The LFPs of the left and right secondary motor cortex (M2), specifically in the gamma band, were more synchronized in APP/PS1 mice than in WT controls, suggesting a declined hemispheric asymmetry of bilateral M2 in this AD mouse model. Notably, the recording and data analysis processes are flexible and easy to carry out, and can also be applied to other brain pathways when conducting experiments that focus on neuronal circuits.},

	abstract = {Hemispheric integration and specialization are two prominent organizational principles for macroscopic brain function. Impairments of interhemispheric cooperation have been reported in schizophrenia patients, but whether such abnormalities should be attributed to eﬀects of illness or familial risk remains inconclusive. Moreover, it is unclear how abnormalities in interhemispheric connectivity impact hemispheric specialization. To address these questions, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large cohort of 253 participants, including 84 schizophrenia patients, 106 of their unaﬀected siblings and 63 healthy controls. Interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization were calculated from resting-state functional connectivity, and compared across groups. Results showed that schizophrenia patients exhibit lower interhemispheric connectivity as compared to controls and siblings. In addition, patients showed higher levels of hemispheric specialization as compared to siblings. Level of interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization correlated with duration of illness in patients. No signiﬁcant alterations were identiﬁed in siblings relative to controls on both measurements. Furthermore, alterations in interhemispheric connectivity correlated with changes in hemispheric specialization in patients relative to controls and siblings. Taken together, these results suggest that lower interhemispheric connectivity and associated abnormalities in hemispheric specialization are features of established illness, rather than an expression of preexistent familial risk for schizophrenia.},

In some experimental designs, this temporal structure can be difﬁcult to deﬁne. In other cases, experimenters may wish to take a more exploratory, data-driven approach to detecting task-driven BOLD activity. In this study, we demonstrate the efﬁciency and power of an inter-subject synchronization approach for exploratory analysis of task-based fMRI data. Combining the tools of instantaneous phase synchronization and independent component analysis, we characterize whole-brain task-driven responses in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this framework to fMRI data collected during performance of a simple motor task and a social cognitive task. Analyses using an inter-subject phase synchronization approach revealed a large number of brain networks that dynamically synchronized to various features of the task, often not predicted by the hypothesized temporal structure of the task. We suggest that this methodological framework, along with readily available tools in the fMRI community, provides a powerful exploratory, data-driven approach for analysis of task-driven BOLD activity.},

The standard method for analysis of brain imaging signals (e.g. fMRI) uses the GLM for each voxel indexed against a specified experimental design but does not explicitly involve temporal dynamics. Consequently, the design variables that determine the functional brain areas are those correlated with the design variation rather than the common or conserved brain areas across subjects with the same temporal dynamics given the same stimulus conditions. This raises an important theoretical question: Are temporal dynamics conserved across individuals experiencing the same stimulus task? This general question can be framed in a dynamical systems context and further be posed as an eigenvalue problem about the conservation of synchrony across all brains simultaneously. We show that solving the problem results in a non-arbitrary measure of temporal dynamics across brains that scales over any number of subjects, stabilizes with increasing sample size, and varies systematically across tasks and stimulus conditions.},

Prior resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in narcolepsy have reported decreased inter/intranetwork connectivity regarding the default mode network (DMN). Recently developed fast fMRI data acquisition allows more precise detection of brain signal propagation with a novel dynamic lag analysis. In this study, we used fast fMRI data to analyze dynamics of inter resting-state network (RSN) information signaling between narcolepsy type 1 patients (NT1, n = 23) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 23). We investigated dynamic connectivity properties between positive and negative peaks and, furthermore, their anticorrelative (pos-neg) counterparts. The lag distributions were significantly (P {\textless} 0.005, familywise error rate corrected) altered in 24 RSN pairs in NT1. The DMN was involved in 83\% of the altered RSN pairs. We conclude that narcolepsy type 1 is characterized with delayed and monotonic inter-RSN information f low especially involving anticorrelations, which are known to be characteristic behavior of the DMN regarding neurocognition.},

We now know that many other species exhibit directionally consistent cerebral and behavioral asymmetries. Nevertheless, the predominance of left-cerebral dominance for language and manual functions may have played a special role in human evolution, even though precursors may be found in other animals—and especially in the great apes. I argue that the common cerebral asymmetry for these functions derives from the origins of language in manual gestures. These, in turn, may originate in specialized circuits for grasping that have been identified in primates, and lateralization may have been progressively introduced as praxic and linguistic functions became more complex.},

While participants were presented with locally time-reversed sentences of varying temporal integrity, they performed an auditory pattern-matching task. The major aim of the study was to ﬁnd out whether functional lateralization for speech perception according to the ’Asymmetric Sampling in Time’ (AST) hypothesis shows a similar pattern in elderly individuals as has been previously observed in younger adults. Our ﬁndings indicate that, unlike results previously obtained from younger adults, older individuals did not demonstrate the same pattern of rightward lateralization in response to suprasegmental speech cues in the three auditory regions of interest (ROI), namely Heschl's gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT) and posterior lateral superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). A frequentist statistical approach did not yield evidence for functional lateralization in the aging brain, and this was corroborated by Bayesian evidence which supported the absence of lateralization in older adults in response to the suprasegmental manipulation. However, a relationship between structural measurements and functional responses demonstrated that individuals with thicker right PT showed less variance in lateralization. Hence, this study extends the division of labour between the left and the right auditory cortex during the processing of continuous spoken language as proposed by the 'AST'-hypothesis in younger adults to a lifespan context.},

	abstract = {Selection of action may rely on external guidance or be motivated internally, engaging partially distinct cerebral networks. With age, there is an increased allocation of sensorimotor processing resources, accompanied by a reduced differentiation between the two networks of action selection. The present study examines the age effects on the motor-related oscillatory patterns related to the preparation of externally and internally guided movements. Thirty-two older and 30 younger adults underwent three delayed motor tasks with S1 as preparatory and S2 as imperative cue: Full, laterality instructed by S1 (external guidance); Free, laterality freely selected (internal guidance); None, laterality instructed by S2 (no preparation). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using 64 surface electrodes. Motor-Related Amplitude Asymmetries (MRAA), indexing the lateralization of oscillatory activities, were analyzed within the S1-S2 interval in the mu (9–12 Hz) and low beta (15–20 Hz) motor-related frequency bands. Reaction times to S2 were slower in older than younger subjects, and slower in the Free than in the Full condition in older subjects only. In the Full condition, there were significant mu MRAA in both age groups, and significant low beta MRAA only in older adults. The Free condition was associated with large mu MRAA in younger adults and limited low beta MRAA in older adults. In younger subjects, the lateralization of mu activity in both Full and Free conditions indicated effective external and internal motor preparation. In older subjects, external motor preparation was associated with lateralization of low beta in addition with mu activity, compatible with an increase of motor-related resources. In contrast, absence of mu and limited low beta lateralization in internal motor preparation was concomitant with reaction time slowing and suggested less efficient cerebral processes subtending free movement selection in older adults, indicating reduced capacity for internally driven action with age.},

	abstract = {Brain lateralization is a widely studied topic, however there has been little work focused on lateralization of intrinsic networks (regions showing similar patterns of covariation among voxels) in the resting brain. In this study, we evaluate resting state network lateralization in an age and gender-balanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset comprising over 600 healthy subjects ranging in age from 12 to 71. After establishing sample-wide network lateralization properties, we continue with an investigation of age and gender effects on network lateralization. All data was gathered on the same scanner and preprocessed using an automated pipeline (Scott et al., 2011). Networks were extracted via group independent component analysis (gICA) (Calhoun et al., 2001). Twenty-eight resting state networks discussed in previous (Allen et al., 2011) work were re-analyzed with a focus on lateralization. We calculated homotopic voxelwise measures of laterality in addition to a global lateralization measure, called the laterality cofactor, for each network. As expected, many of the intrinsic brain networks were lateralized. For example, the visual network was strongly right lateralized, auditory network and default mode networks were mostly left lateralized. Attentional and frontal networks included nodes that were left lateralized and other nodes that were right lateralized. Age was strongly related to lateralization in multiple regions including sensorimotor network regions precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus; and visual network regions lingual gyrus; attentional network regions inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule and middle temporal gyrus; and frontal network regions including the inferior frontal gyrus. Gender showed signiﬁcant effects mainly in two regions, including visual and frontal networks. For example, the inferior frontal gyrus was more right lateralized in males. Signiﬁcant effects of age were found in sensorimotor and visual networks on the global measure. In summary, we report a large-sample of lateralization study that ﬁnds intrinsic functional brain networks to be highly lateralized, with regions that are strongly related to gender and age locally, and with age a strong factor in lateralization, and gender exhibiting a trend-level effect on global measures of laterality.},

The impact of amyloid pathology and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) on resting state lateralization has not been investigated. Due to the preferential involvement of the left hemisphere in verbal tasks, there may be a beneﬁt to higher levels of left-lateralization in the performance of verbal memory tasks. Here we compared functional lateralization of the anterior and posterior DMN between four groups of participants: amyloid negative (A␤-) and amyloid positive (A␤+) groups with normal cognition (NC), and A␤+ groups with mild cognitive impairment (A␤+MCI) or dementia (A␤+AD). Differences were evident between groups in posterior DMN; the A␤-NC group was more left-lateralized than both cognitively impaired A␤+ groups. There was no difference in anterior DMN. No differences in overall network connectivity between groups were observed, suggesting that the functional lateralization ﬁnding is not secondary to general changes in connectivity. Left-lateralization of both networks was associated with better verbal recall performance. Older subjects, overall, had less left functional lateralization of the anterior DMN.},

The distribution of intrinsic networks in the resting brain is strongly related to cognitive function, gender and age. In this study, a longitudinal design with 1 year’s duration was used to evaluate the cognitive training effects on the lateralization of intrinsic networks among healthy older adults. The subjects were divided into two groups randomly: one with multi-domain cognitive training over 3 months and the other as a waitlist control group. Resting state fMRI data were acquired before training and 1 year after training. We analyzed the functional lateralization in 10 common resting state fMRI networks. We observed statically signiﬁcant training effects on the lateralization of two important RSNs related to high-level cognition: right- and left- frontoparietal networks (FPNs). The lateralization of the left-FPN was retained especially well in the training group but decreased in the control group. The increased lateralization with aging was observed in the cerebellum network (CereN), in which the lateralization was signiﬁcantly increased in the control group, although the same change tendency was observed in the training group. These ﬁndings indicate that the lateralization of the high-level cognitive intrinsic networks is sensitive to multi-domain cognitive training. This study provides neuroimaging evidence to support the hypothesis that cognitive training should have an advantage in preventing cognitive decline in healthy older adults.},

As shown before, the calculation of a lateralization index suffers from a number of drawbacks, namely vulnerability to statistical outliers, data sparsity, thresholding effects and lack of taking into account regional variability of activation. Optional processing steps investigated here seem to increase reliability of the suchcalculated indices. To allow a more standardized, reproducible and accessible evaluation of laterality effects, current and new approaches have been implemented in a versatile toolbox running within the spm2 or spm5 software environment.},

	abstract = {Despite the substantial literature on the functional architecture of the asymmetries of the human brain, which has been accumulating for more than 130 years since Dax and Broca’s early reports, the biological foundations of cerebral asymmetries are still poorly understood. Recent advances in comparative cognitive neurosciences have made available new animal models that have started to provide unexpected insights into the evolutionary origins and neuronal mechanisms of cerebral asymmetries. Animal model-systems, particularly those provided by the avian brain, highlight the interrelations of genetic, hormonal and environmental events to produce neural and behavioural asymmetries. Novel evidences showing that functional and structural lateralization of the brain is widespread among vertebrates Žincluding fish, reptiles and amphibians. have accumulated rapidly. Perceptual asymmetries, in particular, seem to be ubiquitous in everyday behaviour of most species of animals with laterally placed eyes; in organisms with wider binocular overlap Že.g., amphibians., they appear to be retained for initial detection of stimuli in the extreme lateral fields. We speculate that adjustment of head position and eye movements may play a similar role in mammals with frontal vision as does the choice for right or left lateral visual fields in animals with laterally placed eyes. A first attempt to trace back the origins of brain asymmetry to early vertebrates is presented, based on the hypothesis that functional incompatibility between the logical demands associated with very basic cognitive functions is central to the phenomenon of cerebral lateralization. q 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations occur in a wide variety of biological organisms from bacteria to humans as well as financial, chemical and complex physical systems. Multistability refers to noise driven switches between multiple weakly stable states. Scale-invariant fluctuations arise when there is an approximately constant ratio between the mean and standard deviation of a system’s fluctuations. Both are an important property of human perception, movement, decision making and computation and they occur together in the human alpha rhythm, imparting it with complex dynamical behavior. Here, we elucidate their fundamental dynamical mechanisms in a canonical model of nonlinear bifurcations under stochastic fluctuations. We find that the co-occurrence of multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations mandates two important dynamical properties: Multistability arises in the presence of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, which generates coexisting attractors, whilst the introduction of multiplicative (state-dependent) noise ensures that as the system jumps between these attractors, fluctuations remain in constant proportion to their mean and their temporal statistics become long-tailed. The simple algebraic construction of this model affords a systematic analysis of the contribution of stochastic and nonlinear processes to cortical rhythms, complementing a recently proposed biophysical model. Similar dynamics also occur in a kinetic model of gene regulation, suggesting universality across a broad class of biological phenomena.},

The discovery of chaotic itinerancy in high-dimensional dynamical systems with and without a noise term has motivated a new interpretation of this dynamic neural activity, cast in terms of the high-dimensional transitory dynamics among “exotic” attractors. This interpretation is quite different from the conventional one, cast in terms of simple behavior on low-dimensional attractors. Skarda and Freeman (1987) presented evidence in support of the conclusion that animals cannot memorize odor without chaotic activity of neuron populations. Following their work, we study the role of chaotic dynamics in biological information processing, perception, and memory. We propose a new coding scheme of information in chaos-driven contracting systems we refer to as Cantor coding. Since these systems are found in the hippocampal formation and also in the olfactory system, the proposed coding scheme should be of biological significance.

Attention is given to the relationship between Gamma activity and the heterogeneous symptoms of schizophrenia.

In neural systems, scale-free activity is often neglected in electrophysiological research. Here, we investigate scale-free dynamics in human brain and show that it contains extensive nested frequencies, with the phase of lower frequencies modulating the amplitude of higher frequencies in an upward progression across the frequency spectrum. The functional signiﬁcance of scale-free brain activity is indicated by task performance modulation and regional variation, with b being larger in default network and visual cortex and smaller in hippocampus and cerebellum. The precise patterns of nested frequencies in the brain differ from other scale-free dynamics in nature, such as earth seismic waves and stock market ﬂuctuations, suggesting system-speciﬁc generative mechanisms. Our ﬁndings reveal robust temporal structures and behavioral signiﬁcance of scale-free brain activity and should motivate future study on its physiological mechanisms and cognitive implications.},

In this review,we first describe an introductory-level thought experiment to provide the reader with an intuitive understanding of criticality. Second, we discuss some practical approaches for investigating criticality. Finally, we review quantitative evidence that three functional properties of the cortex are optimized at criticality: 1) dynamic range, 2) information transmission, and 3) information capacity.We focus on recently reported experimental evidence and briefly discuss the theory and history of these ideas.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientiﬁc interest and have signiﬁcant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large ﬂuctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the diﬃculty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares ﬁtting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood ﬁtting methods with goodness-of-ﬁt tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of diﬀerent disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we ﬁnd these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {Criticality has emerged as a leading dynamical candidate for healthy and pathological neuronal activity. At the heart of criticality in neural systems is the need for parameters to be tuned to speciﬁc values or for the existence of self-organizing mechanisms. Existing models lack precise physiological descriptions for how the brain maintains its tuning near a critical point. In this paper we argue that a key ingredient missing from the ﬁeld is a formulation of reciprocal coupling between neural activity and metabolic resources. We propose that the constraint of optimizing the balance between energy use and activity plays a major role in tuning brain states to lie near criticality. Important recent ﬁndings aligned with our viewpoint have emerged from analyses of disorders that involve severe metabolic disturbances and alter scale-free properties of brain dynamics, including burst suppression. Moreover, we argue that average shapes of neuronal avalanches are a signature of scale-free activity that offers sharper insights into underlying mechanisms than afforded by traditional analyses of avalanche statistics.},

Here, we reinvestigated the asymmetry and lateralization (i.e., asymmetry directed toward one hemisphere) of grey-matter (GM) distribution in 35 patients with AD, 24 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, a state of increased risk for AD), and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). We analyzed GM distribution by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) including analyses for asymmetry and lateralization. When comparing MCI with AD patients, VBM revealed GM loss in the entorhinal, temporoparietal, dorsofrontal, and occipital cortices as well as in the precuneus; when comparing HCs with MCI patients, we found similar differences, which were less pronounced especially within the temporoparietal cortex and precuneus. Analyses of regional asymmetry and regional lateralization as well as global lateralization did not yield signiﬁcant results. However, lobar asymmetry of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes increased from HC to AD. Moreover, in aMCI and AD patients, performance of language-based neuropsychological tests correlated with lateralization of GM loss to the left hemisphere. We conclude that, in principle, brain atrophy in AD is asymmetric rather than lateralized. At the individual level however, asymmetry contributes to cognitive deﬁcits.},

	abstract = {Traditionally brain function is studied through measuring physiological responses in controlled sensory, motor, and cognitive paradigms. However, even at rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, collections of cortical regions consistently show temporally coherent activity. In humans, these resting state networks have been shown to greatly overlap with functional architectures present during consciously directed activity, which motivates the interpretation of rest activity as day dreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. In monkeys, it has been shown though that similar coherent fluctuations are present during deep anesthesia when there is no consciousness. Here, we show that comparable resting state networks emerge from a stability analysis of the network dynamics using biologically realistic primate brain connectivity, although anatomical information alone does not identify the network. We specifically demonstrate that noise and time delays via propagation along connecting fibres are essential for the emergence of the coherent fluctuations of the default network. The spatiotemporal network dynamics evolves on multiple temporal scales and displays the intermittent neuroelectric oscillations in the fast frequency regimes, 1–100 Hz, commonly observed in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as the hemodynamic oscillations in the ultraslow regimes, ,0.1 Hz, observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. The combination of anatomical structure and time delays creates a space–time structure in which the neural noise enables the brain to explore various functional configurations representing its dynamic repertoire.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia with dramatic consequences. The research in structural and functional neuroimaging showed altered brain connectivity in AD. In this study, we investigated the wholebrain resting state functional connectivity (FC) of the subjects with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (PAD), mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impact of APOE4 carriership, as well as in relation to variations in core AD CSF biomarkers. The synchronization in the wholebrain was monotonously decreasing during the course of the disease progression. Furthermore, in AD patients we found widespread signiﬁcant decreases in functional connectivity (FC) strengths particularly in the brain regions with high global connectivity. We employed a whole-brain computational modeling approach to study the mechanisms underlying these alterations. To characterize the causal interactions between brain regions, we estimated the eﬀective connectivity (EC) in the model. We found that the signiﬁcant EC diﬀerences in AD were primarily located in left temporal lobe. Then, we systematically manipulated the underlying dynamics of the model to investigate simulated changes in FC based on the healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we found distinct patterns involving CSF biomarkers of amyloid-beta (Aβ1− 42) total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). CSF Aβ1 −42 was associated to the contrast between healthy control subjects and clinical groups. Nevertheless, tau CSF biomarkers were associated to the variability in whole-brain synchronization and sensory integration regions. These associations were robust across clinical groups, unlike the associations that were found for CSF Aβ1 −42. APOE4 carriership showed no signiﬁcant correlations with the connectivity measures.},

	abstract = {Understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing fluctuating oscillations in large-scale cortical circuits is a crucial prelude to a proper knowledge of their role in both adaptive and pathological cortical processes. Neuroscience research in this area has much to gain from understanding the Kuramoto model, a mathematical model that speaks to the very nature of coupled oscillating processes, and which has elucidated the core mechanisms of a range of biological and physical phenomena. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to the Kuramoto model in its original, rather abstract, form and then focus on modifications that increase its neurobiological plausibility by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity. The extended model elicits elaborate spatial patterns of synchronous oscillations that exhibit persistent dynamical instabilities reminiscent of cortical activity. We review how the Kuramoto model may be recast from an ordinary differential equation to a population level description using the nonlinear Fokker–Planck equation. We argue that such formulations are able to provide a mechanistic and unifying explanation of oscillatory phenomena in the human cortex, such as fluctuating beta oscillations, and their relationship to basic computational processes including multistability, criticality, and information capacity.},

Using large-scale neuroimaging empirical data from 1,003 healthy participants, we demonstrate turbulent-like human brain dynamics. Furthermore, we build a whole-brain model with coupled oscillators to demonstrate that the best ﬁt to the data corresponds to a region of maximally developed turbulent-like dynamics, which also corresponds to maximal sensitivity to the processing of external stimulations (information capability). The model shows the economy of anatomy by following the exponential distance rule of anatomical connections as a cost-of-wiring principle. This establishes a ﬁrm link between turbulent-like brain activity and optimal brain function. Overall, our results reveal a way of analyzing and modeling whole-brain dynamics that suggests a turbulent-like dynamic intrinsic backbone facilitating large-scale network communication.},

This may involve detecting structural and functional cerebral changes such as changes in the degree of asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. Changes can be detected by computational algorithms and used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its stages (amnestic early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)), and can help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the paper proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the analysis of structural changes, and machine learning classiﬁcation of the pathology. The experiments provide promising results, distinguishing between subjects with normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or progressive dementia. Supervised machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks tested are reaching an accuracy of 92.5\% and 75.0\% for NC vs. EMCI, and 93.0\% and 90.5\% for NC vs. AD, respectively. The proposed pipeline offers a promising low-cost alternative for the classiﬁcation of dementia and can be potentially useful to other brain degenerative disorders that are accompanied by changes in the brain asymmetries.},

A particularly important tool for these investigations has been resting-state functional connectivity. Attempts to comprehensively synthesize resting-state functional connectivity results have focused on the potential utility of functional connectivity as a biomarker for disease risk, disease staging, or prognosis. While these are all appropriate uses of this technique, the purpose of this review is to examine how functional connectivity disruptions inform our understanding of AD pathophysiology. Here, we examine the rationale and methodological considerations behind functional connectivity studies and then provide a critical review of the existing literature.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) appears to be a uniquely human condition, which is possibly attributable to our expanded longevity and peculiar capacity for episodic memory. Due to a lack of naturally-occurring animal model for investigating AD pathogenesis, our knowledge about the disease must be derived from correlational observation of humans, or from animal models produced by genetic manipulation of known risk factors in humans. Advances in neuroimaging, cellular and molecular science, and computational methods have proven useful for the improvement of such techniques, but the general limitation persists; as a result we remain without clear answers to some of the fundamental questions posed by AD. On the other hand, much progress has been made in characterizing the longitudinal progression of AD pathology, which includes the formation of ‘‘plaques and tangles’’, a distinct topological pattern of atrophy of grey and white matter, and the concurrent decline of speciﬁc cognitive functions, beginning with mild memory impairments and ending with general debilitating dementia. In this review, we ﬁrst discuss the existing literature which characterizes AD etiology, pathology, and pathogenesis, with the intention of framing the disease as primarily a ‘‘disconnection syndrome’’. We next describe methodologies for investigating the topological properties of human brain networks, using graph theoretical techniques and connectivity information derived from anatomical and diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Finally, we discuss how these methodologies have been applied to systems-level analyses of AD, to help characterize the network changes underlying the disease process, and how these patterns relate to speciﬁc cognitive outcome measures.},

Even so, we know very little about how the brain’s networks change in AD, and which metrics are best to evaluate these changes. To better understand how AD affects brain connectivity, we analyzed anatomical connectivity based on 3-T diffusion-weighted images from 111 subjects (15 with AD, 68 with mild cognitive impairment, and 28 healthy elderly; mean age, 73.7 – 7.6 SD years). We performed whole brain tractography based on the orientation distribution functions, and compiled connectivity matrices showing the proportions of detected ﬁbers interconnecting 68 cortical regions. We computed a variety of measures sensitive to anatomical network topology, including the structural backbone—the so-called ‘‘k-core’’—of the anatomical network, and the nodal degree. We found widespread network disruptions, as connections were lost in AD. Among other connectivity measures showing disease effects, network nodal degree, normalized characteristic path length, and efﬁciency decreased with disease, while normalized small-worldness increased, in the whole brain and left and right hemispheres individually. The normalized clustering coefﬁcient also increased in the whole brain; we discuss factors that may cause this effect. The proportions of ﬁbers intersecting left and right cortical regions were asymmetrical in all diagnostic groups. This asymmetry may intensify as disease progressed. Connectivity metrics based on the k-core may help understand brain network breakdown as cognitive impairment increases, revealing how degenerative diseases affect the human connectome.},

In this paper, we sought to investigate brain connectivity in AD via the study of a crossmodal effect. More precisely, we examined the integration of auditory and visual speech information (the McGurk effect) in AD patients and matched control subjects. Our results revealed impaired crossmodal integration during speech perception in AD, which was not associated with disturbances in the separate processing of auditory and visual speech stimuli. In conclusion, our data suggest the occurrence of a speciﬁc, audio-visual integration deﬁcit in AD, which might be the consequence of a connectivity breakdown and corroborate the observation from other studies of crossmodal deﬁcits between the auditory and visual modalities in this population.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This paper presents a comprehensive EEG study for interhemispheric, intrahemispheric, and distal coherence in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. The objective is to glean new insights into the brain of AD patients.
Methods: EEGs are obtained from 20 AD-probable patients and 7 healthy (control) subjects. Pair-wise electrode coherence is calculated over each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, and beta).
Results: One-way ANOVA test shows a set of statistically signiﬁcant differences in electrode coherence between AD and controls. In general, AD patients present a signiﬁcant pattern of increase in the left intrahemispheric frontal coherence in the delta, theta, and alpha bands, an increase in the left intrahemispheric temporo-parietal coherence in all bands, and a decrease in the right temporo-parieto-central coherence in all bands. The increase in left temporo-parietal, temporo-central, and frontal coherence of AD patients in speciﬁc bands, being most pronounced in the theta band, could be attributed to compensatory mechanisms that attempt to make up for the decrease in memory and cognitive functions caused by the progression of AD.
Conclusions: The coherence study presented in this paper shows a pattern of decrease in AD coherence, indicating a decline in cortical connectivity. Exceptions are seen in speciﬁc bands where an increase in coherence can be attributed to compensatory mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Objective: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the corpus callosum (CC), which plays a key role in interhemispheric coupling in high-demand conditions. Using 3D callosal measurements and a letter-matching paradigm, this 2-part study investigated the neural substrate of interhemispheric coupling in individuals with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and age-matched healthy individuals (HC). Method: Thirty-three right-handed participants were MRI scanned to measure the volume of the CC in 5 sections. In Study 1, AD, a-MCI, and HC individuals performed a low-demand perceptual letter shape-matching task (e.g., A-A); in Study 2, a-MCI and HC individuals performed a “case-sensitive” letter-matching task (Study 2A) and a “load-sensitive” lettermatching task (Study 2B). Results: The results showed a positive correlation between Response Times and the midbody of the CC at the lowest cognitive demand level (Study 1) in participants with AD, and the total CC, midbody, caudal body, and isthmus of the CC at high cognitive demand levels (Study 2A) in normal aging. The volume of the anterior part of the CC was significantly negatively correlated with the interhemispheric behavioral indices for the a-MCI group (Study 1 and Study 2B). Conclusion: This study provides evidence that interhemispheric coupling may constitute a flexible mechanism that can improve the brain’s ability to meet processing demands for low cognitive demand in AD and for high cognitive demand in normal aging.},

Methods: 11 patients underwent both magnetic resonance imaging and quantitative electroencephalography to assess corpus callosum size and interhemispheric coherence. For comparison, corpus callosum size was measured in 24 healthy elderly control subjects.
Results: Corpus callosum cross sectional area was significantly reduced in Alzheimer patients relative to controls. Posterior interhemispheric coherence (a and b frequencies) correlated significantly with the size of posterior corpus callosum area, and anterior coherence (d, h, and a frequencies) with the size of anterior corpus callosum area in the Alzheimer patients.
Conclusion: Region specific correlations between corpus callosum size and EEG coherence suggest that the decline in interhemispheric connectivity in Alzheimer’s disease results from a specific loss of cortical association neurones projecting through the corpus callosum.},

The technique of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) analysis was applied to explore the aberrant connectivity of all patients. The results showed that: (1) the statistically significant connections of interhemispheric brain regions included DMN-related brain regions (i.e. precuneus, calcarine, fusiform, cuneus, lingual gyrus, temporal inferior gyrus, and hippocampus), SN-related brain regions (i.e. frontoinsular cortex), and ECN-related brain regions (i.e. frontal middle gyrus and frontal inferior); (2) the precuneus and frontal middle gyrus in the AD group exhibited lower VMHC values than those in the aMCI and healthy control (HC) groups, but no significant difference was observed between the aMCI and HC groups; and (3) significant correlations were found between peak VMHC results from the precuneus and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Scale (MOCA) scores and their factor scores in the AD, aMCI, and AD plus aMCI groups, and between the results from the frontal middle gyrus and MOCA factor scores in the aMCI group. These findings indicated that impaired interhemispheric functional connectivity was observed in AD and could be a sensitive neuroimaging biomarker for AD. More specifically, the DMN was inhibited, while the SN and ECN were excited. VMHC results were correlated with MMSE and MOCA scores, highlighting that VMHC could be a sensitive neuroimaging biomarker for AD and the progression from aMCI to AD.},

Methods: EEG interhemispheric coherence was analyzed for each harmonic responses during PS (white ﬂickers at 5, 10 and 15 ﬂashes/ sec) in younger subjects (20–25 years), non-demented elderly subjects (50–67 years) and AD patients (43–66 years).
Results: The elderly subjects had higher interhemispheric coherence during PS than the younger subjects, with signiﬁcant differences found in the 6th (30 Hz) and 8th (40 Hz) harmonic responses to 5 Hz PS. The AD patients had signiﬁcantly smaller coherence than the elderly subjects in the 2nd (10 Hz) and 4th (20 Hz) harmonic responses to 5 Hz PS, and in the fundamental (10 Hz) and 2nd (20 Hz) harmonic responses to 10 Hz PS. These coherence values did not correlate with duration of the disease or with cognitive functioning as evaluated by MMSE score.
Conclusions: A failure of stimulation-related brain activation in AD patients was observed in alpha-related frequencies, suggesting that AD is not the end result of normal aging of the brain, at least in terms of the mechanisms which are involved in PS-related functional organization. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Methods: Ninety-ﬁve patients with newly diagnosed AD at different stages from four neurologic institutes were enrolled for the study. Standard scalp resting EEG data were collected for quantitative analysis. Global band power ratio and interhemispheric alpha band coherence were calculated.
Results: Patients with advanced AD had a greater slow-to-fast wave power ratio. Among several power ratio parameters, global theta and delta to alpha and beta band power ratio showed the best correlation with stages of AD (p {\textless} 0.05 between any two patient groups). Patients with advanced AD had decreased coherence in multiple brain regions. The phenomenon was most prominent in the centroparietal region (p {\textless} 0.05 between any two patient groups).
Conclusion: Increased global slow-to-fast power ratio and decreased centroparietal interhemispheric alpha band coherence are strongly correlated with disease progress in AD},

Although compelling evidence supports reduced segregation and increased integration in whole-brain functional connectivity with aging, the age effect on the reorganization of large-scale functional networks at the hemispheric level remains unclear. Here, we aimed to examine age-related differences in inter-hemispheric interactions and intra-hemispheric integration by using resting-state functional MRI data of a healthy adult lifespan sample. The results showed that age-related decreases in inter-hemispheric integration were found in entire functional networks in both hemispheres, except for the sensorimotor network (SMN) and posterior default mode network (DMN). Specifically, aging was accompanied by increasing inter-hemispheric segregation in the left frontoparietal network (FPN) and left ventral attention network (VAN), as well as right-brain networks located in the auditory network (AN), visual network (VN), and temporal parts of the DMN. Moreover, aging was associated with increasing intrahemispheric integration within the bilateral VN and posterior DMN while decreasing intra-hemispheric integration within the right VAN. These remarkable changes with aging confirm that there are dynamic interactions between functional networks across the lifespan and provide a means of investigating the mechanisms of cognitive aging.},

Current theories indicate that age-related intrinsic brain functional reorganization may be a critical marker of cognitive aging. Yet, little is known about how intrinsic interhemispheric functional connectivity changes with age in adults, and how this relates to critical executive functions. To address this, we examined voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), a metric that quantiﬁes interhemispheric communication, in 93 healthy volunteers (age range: 19–85) with executive function assessment using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) scales. Resting functional MRI data were analyzed to assess VMHC, and then a multiple linear regression model was employed to evaluate the relationship between age and the whole-brain VMHC. We observed age-related reductions in VMHC of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe subsystem, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula in salience network, and inferior parietal lobule in frontoparietal control network. Performance on the color-word inhibition task was associated with VMHC of vmPFC and insula, and VMHC of vmPFC mediated the relationship between age and CWIT inhibition reaction times. The percent ratio of correct design scores in design ﬂuency test correlated positively with VMHC of the inferior parietal lobule. The current study suggests that brain interhemispheric functional alterations may be a promising new avenue for understanding age-related cognitive decline.},

Some evidence suggests that neurodegeneration related to aging and disease may preferentially affect the left—usually language- and motor-dominant—hemisphere. Here, we used activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis to assess gray matter (GM) loss and its lateralization in healthy aging and in neurodegeneration, namely, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD). This meta-analysis, comprising 159 voxel-based morphometry publications (enrolling 4,469 patients and 4,307 controls), revealed that GM decline appeared to be asymmetric at trend levels but provided no evidence for increased left-hemisphere vulnerability. Regions with asymmetric GM decline were located in areas primarily affected by neurodegeneration. In HD, the left putamen showed converging evidence for more pronounced atrophy, while no consistent pattern was found in PD. In MCI, the right hippocampus was more atrophic than its left counterpart, a pattern that reversed in AD. The stability of these ﬁndings was conﬁrmed using permutation tests. However, due to the lenient threshold used in the asymmetry analysis, further work is needed to conﬁrm our results and to provide a better understanding of the functional role of GM asymmetries, for instance in the context of cognitive reserve and compensation.

Seventy‐five subjects drawn from a larger normal aging cohort were evaluated in terms of MRI and neuropsychological parameters at two moments (M1 and M2), 18 months apart. In this time frame, asymmetry as measured by structural laterality index (ΔLI) was stable regarding both direction and magnitude in all areas. However, a significantly higher dispersion for this variation was observed in subcortical over cortical areas. Subjects with extreme increase in rightward lateralization of the caudate revealed increased M1 to M2 Stroop interference scores, but also a worsening of general cognition (MMSE). In contrast, subjects showing extreme increase in leftward lateralization of the thalamus presented higher increase in Stroop interference scores. In conclusion, while a decline in cognitive function was observed in the entire sample, regional brain asymmetries were relatively stable. Neuropsychological trajectories were associated with laterality changes in subcortical regions.},

The morphology of this brain region changes with age. However, there are few quantitative magnetic resonance imaging studies of ERC morphology across the healthy adult lifespan. In this study, we quantified ERC volume, thickness, surface area, and curvature in a large number of subjects spanning seven decades of life. Using structural MRI data from 563 healthy subjects ranging from 19 to 86 years of age, we explored the adult lifespan trajectory of ERC volume, thickness, surface and curvature. ERC volume, thickness, and surface area initially increased with age, reaching a peak at about 32 years, 40 years, and 50 years of age, respectively, after which they decreased with age. ERC volume and surface area were hemispherically leftward asymmetric, whereas ERC thickness was hemispherically rightward asymmetric, with no gender differences. The direction of asymmetry differed across the measures. This informs previous inconsistencies in reports of ERC asymmetry. ERC aging began in mid-adulthood. At this stage of life, it may be important to adopt some strategies to reduce the effects of aging on cognition.},

	abstract = {Background: Predicting the prognosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has outstanding clinical value, and the hippocampal volume is a reliable imaging biomarker of AD diagnosis.
Objective: We aimed to longitudinally assess hippocampal sub-regional difference (volume and asymmetry) among progressive MCI (pMCI), stable MCI (sMCI) patients, and normal elderly.
Methods: We identiﬁed 29 pMCI, 52 sMCI, and 102 normal controls (NC) from the ADNI database. All participants underwent neuropsychological assessment and 3T MRI scans three times. The time interval between consecutive MRI sessions was about 1 year. Volumes of hippocampal subﬁeld were measured by Freesurfer. Based on the analysis of variance, repeated measures analyses, and receiver operating characteristic curves, we compared cross-sectional and longitudinal alteration sub-regional volume and asymmetry index.
Results: Compared to NC, both MCI groups showed signiﬁcant atrophy in all subﬁelds. At baseline, pMCI have a smaller volume than sMCI in the bilateral subiculum, molecular layer (ML), the molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4, and right tail. Furthermore, repeated measures analyses revealed that pMCI patients showed a faster volume loss than sMCI in bilateral subiculum and ML. After controlling for age, gender, and education, most results remained unchanged. However, none of the hippocampal sub-regional volumes performed better than the whole hippocampus in ROC analyses, and no asymmetric difference between pMCI and sMCI was found.
Conclusion: The faster volume loss in subiculum and ML suggest a higher risk of disease progression in MCI patients. The hippocampal asymmetry may have smaller value in predicting the MCI prognosis.},

	abstract = {In recent studies, neuroanatomical volume and shape asymmetries have been seen during the course of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and could potentially be used as preclinical imaging biomarkers for the prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. In this study, a deep learning framework utilizing Siamese neural networks trained on paired lateral inter-hemispheric regions is used to harness the discriminative power of whole-brain volumetric asymmetry. The method uses the MRICloud pipeline to yield low-dimensional volumetric features of pre-defined atlas brain structures, and a novel non-linear kernel trick to normalize these features to reduce batch effects across datasets and populations. By working with the low-dimensional features, Siamese networks were shown to yield comparable performance to studies that utilize whole-brain MR images, with the advantage of reduced complexity and computational time, while preserving the biological information density. Experimental results also show that Siamese networks perform better in certain metrics by explicitly encoding the asymmetry in brain volumes, compared to traditional prediction methods that do not use the asymmetry, on the ADNI and BIOCARD datasets.},
